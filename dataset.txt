I think it is a Soda joke. When soda loses it's carbonation it is called flat. Oof. Lior has got you dead to rights. Phineas and Ferb didn't predict the future, it MADE the future. Wow, good eye Yoshi It's not the quantity that matters, it's the quality of the ping.  Too much ping. burh Actually, in my experience the laptop will get hotter because it has smaller fans. I will too. 😄 You're right... We should teleport it there too! I would DIE for spice. Thanks! (Just link it here) I'm surprised I didn't follow you already. I'll do that now.  Oh no! You caught me. 🤣 What can I say, the fake-out at the end made me laugh and the meme going in reverse was clever. Posted on behalf of Moist Coffee: A little bit of both, right? It is a sad day when basket balls grow on trees.  That's hilarious! I have brought peace in out time! https://tenor.com/view/peace-peaceinourtime-chamberlain-gif-21039125 I approve of this meme. Posted on behalf of MoistCoffee: Sadly true. Describe History Before Europe In 4 Words: Knock Knock It's Rome. Ha ha, that works! Not a spring. 😂 I think it's a slink And sometimes the worst! Either way it makes for fun history. This taught me something really cool. Great meme! https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/qhl0n4/this_little_girls_rock_displayed_in_my_local/ ^ This made me chuckle. I like Muh ha ha ha! Shout out to  for the meme. I am soo hype for the Froggy Chair's return. Pfftt... I would only believe him if it were Netherite. You would be surprised. Some people never learn how to do it. Oh, that's a good idea. I'll consider that. Maybe a story for another day. 😅 But aside from that, I don't swear. I used the F-Bomb once on accident. Kind of a weird story. https://tenor.com/view/spiderman-magic-no-no-sabrina-tv-gif-14293457 As a rule of thumb, if I've used the word in my videos then it's alright. Yes.  The battle of the century!  (My money's on paper.) https://tenor.com/view/blunder-princess-bride-you-fool-gullible-gotcha-gif-14120688 Think Link! Think! Lets hope it's option number 1. Oh dear. Yes. 1. No. 2. No. 3. This is a family friendly server. [Kind of funny, but still had to delete it] [Post deleted for referencing inappropriate body parts.]  But of course! I enjoy periodically scrolling through all the channel on the Discord.  Weird enough, Navi is my favorite companion in the Zelda series. She's not snarky like Midna, and she's cute. Good ole Hearts of Iron. I love watching people play that game. It's beautiful. He specifically said, "You need to use that spinning song"  Ayy! My brother would be proud. That gag was his idea in the Relics video.  That Aladdin GIF is perfect. 😄 That is science right there. Battling gravity! You must live near the equator. That's why the world is sideways.  I acknowledge thou! Oof https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGm1_b8oY0 Oh, that's what you're talking about. Carry on. What? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMGyyc6OrOs Yah, history memes have to simplify the events to make them funnier.  As long as you don't take them seriously as historical documents then you're good. The Mexico City meme is too accurate. Those Aztecs were nuts. 😂  That cat meme is adorable. ^ Me  That video was uploaded 3 weeks ago. 😋 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrWTZlUOqRc Poor onions. Meme in question has been deleted just to avoid confusion. Sadly it is. Indeed. I don't want to see any swearing on this server.  You're getting a first warning.  That is a no-no meme. Bad word. I see them as the second world war. (Only pros will remember the 7 Years War as the first world war) I am getting History Memes Reddit vibes now. 😄 The historical memes are on point today. 😁  It talks about drugs. That's enough to delete it.  Meme deleted for swearing. Don't post stuff like that The saplings are pretending to be bushes. 😋 Nice coffee. 😄 Yummy. 😄 Yes Too dark for this server. Not a fan of this meme. Too dark. Point taken. This was too strange for me. (The undertale one.) I might need to use that video. That's clever right there. ^ 😄 He skipped leg day. And he couldn't climb. Dang. That didn't work. Burn Darn. But I wanted soup.  ^ Soup meme. Wholesome clean fun. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh_tGOSKnRo No. Not mine. 😄 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUH3_TRKqM4&list=WL&index=14 They are pretty funny. 😂 Someone made an impressive animation of the CDI merchant today. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Rj9mHj79E&feature=youtu.be https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/398209508985274379/802236552146976788/EsTQ1VRXUAIhTMX.png?width=1071&height=676 Wouldn't be the first time it's happened. Way to go fishy! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLzzaSalKyg I'll look into it. 😉 Messing with my arch rival is fun. Lies! That is tea! He was a dance teacher that became a meme. o_o That's too much for me. This is catchy. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLYhnBaWOzc&list=WL I need a link to this story. I want to know how Mr potato head is involved. Let's throw him overboard! No! Not our cheese! Fair enough! Rap isn't racist. 😅  But it's clear that the video was relating rap to the black population of America.  The meme is deleted now, so there is no need to delve further down that rabbit hole. [Deleted just in case] Eww... racial jokes are a no-no. I don't get it. Cute Bone Doggo! https://c.tenor.com/ioXETuUQSOkAAAAM/they-had-us-in-the-first-half-not-gonna-lie.gif https://c.tenor.com/ZFc20z8DItkAAAAM/facepalm-really.gif I think it's a big deal. Consider the streamers/letsplayers that want to play those games! What if their videos are taken down for including the music? Specifically on SilviaGunner's channel The context for that meme is that Nintendo took down Mario 64, Ocarina of Time, and Mario Kart Wii's music from Youtube. I'm fine with this one. It's an important part of Nintendo news. (still funny) (Ginger ale frog video deleted due to cusses in description of video) https://tenor.com/view/merry-christmas-ho-ho-ho-santa-elf-mean-gif-15816333 https://tenor.com/view/yuck-gross-disgust-eww-steve-carell-gif-3556274 Me when it is not bread.

The questions and answers section is awesome on this article. https://www.wikihow-fun.com/Care-for-Your-Pet-Rock Yall guys are strange. Don't think too hard about memes. They're just funny images. I prefer love to corona. Wait, did you say 3? 😳 They're gonna betray you. They always do. I'll take Ireland. They're good for storing potatoes. That would explain why it's sus Scary milk I love geography so I give this meme a 10/10 Just drink more tea. https://tenor.com/view/fine-its-fine-tea-jessica-chastain-beverly-marsh-gif-14101347 I don't want an F-Bomb hiding in memes. 🥷 We'll remove it for now. Cute kitty https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/650/808/4e5.gif No, I meant neat! 😮 That's neat. Wow, he's lost a lot of weight since I last saw him. Just a bit scary for me. Whew... nice. Can I delete this? I feel like deleting this. 😋 Family Friendly server guys. 😄 It's awful but I can't take my eyes off it. Why have you done this. Amen brother. Amen... Accurate and funny! Art has rarely been so perfect. Darn. x=y+z Done! HW has been around since ancient times. I'm sorry Yoshi, but Roberto isn't a real person. 😄 I've done the HW on this meme since I am subscribed to the History memes sub-reddit. https://marketbusinessnews.com/myth-roberto-invented-homework/235125/ [HW meme deleted for being historically inaccurate.] You have an unparalleled affinity for the memeing. I can tell! Okay, this might be too many memes. 😋  I know this is a meme channel, but it's getting a bit spammy. But of course! My favorite pastime activity. 3d printing. You need more friends then. 😄 Good thing I like Hardcore mode! Water and carbohydrates are keeping me going. Limitations in games are a good thing so long as you can eventually overcome them. Huh, I think that image was in the "Fixing Rain" episode. It's been a while since I've seen that. Who? Sum is a teacher. Man! I'm sorry to hear your week has been so rough. Hopefully it will get easier, although I can't predict what the future holds. I see you're enjoying teaching?  Seriously. Teachers are SO mean for making us write coherent things. I liked the Frozen puns That's a lot of memeing to take in. Oh, so see it. I think that's his mustache. I don't get it. Crap. It's the purple guy from FNAF. Why can't Game Theory stop covering FNAF! I always say, "YES?" because my brain automatically thinks they want to ask me something. What's best about that format is that the background is Link's house from Twilight Princess. So this dude literally just walked into Link's house and claimed it as his own. https://i.redd.it/nk9437qfkgm51.png 🥔 = 🍎 It's a shame really. Games aren't made with Macs in mind. Windows 98 is aesthetically appealing to me. I can't relate, but I feel bad for the dog. So it seems! Sorry . But you're using your Mac the wrong way. 😂 I can't tell what this is. 😖 That's amazing. of all time. The most ambitious crossover... You know what, never mind. The Bikini Bottom can't be real. It's probably a part of the Marvel Universe since it's so weird. And where a lake can exist underwater. It's also the only place where fish talk. Ah yes, The Bikini Bottom. That's my favorite display of cannon power! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Hardtack_I Whole Wheat. But really stale so it's like hardtack It shall be feel from this point on. feel I like to use one word to describe each emote on the server, and I didn't want to use hand since there are already a ton of default hand emotes. Bread pog was put in the brig. Sorry. Unfortunately, only Nitro users can use it.  I don't know how you made that gif, but it's fantastic and I added it to the server. I'll figure it out eventually. I really want to use a mod that adds the BotW Sequel tunic into the game so I can use it for a thumbnail. When you want to try a new mod, but it crashes the game I don't know how to feel about it. I happen to like fall! Me too.  Congrats on the latest run! It matches your interest in the anime and it is a circle which works well in discord. I think so! Fire Fox was a good browser. That's not a bad avatar idea for Tax. Its a girl! https://tenor.com/view/simpsons-russia-soviet-union-gif-11961039 PointCrow is probably communist.

It's a pretty chill reddit. Not a lot of trolls from what I've seen. Thanks for sharing boss! I saw that one on the Chrstianity Reddit today! Solid cross over. 😄  There's no need to give you a "Major Warning" role since I think you were good intentioned, but this server is FAMILY FRIENDLY. So no swearing, even in memes.  Thank you for catching that Cowboy. Message deleted.  Perfect directing, lovely set design. 9/10 Ouch I'm pretty tired so I didn't notice what channel I was in. 😅 I might say the same too you! Lets call it too a vote.  Going once?  Going Twice?  Wow! Would you look at that! A unanimous vote. Not often you see one of those. First Thumbnail it is. Not gonna lie, I'm not a fan of how Zelda 1 Link is hugging the left side of the screen in the bottom pic.  And I also don't like the way it fades in the second to last pic. If I had flipped it without moving Zelda 1 Link then it would have looked a bit like this... The fade is a bit weird in the center unfortunately, but Zelda 1 Link didn't want to cooperate. 😄 Alright, here's the flip-flopped version. Spellbreak? Nonsense! You'll get there with enough patience. :D It took me 9 years just to get to 100 subs so you'll be there in no time. I could do that, but then the title would have to be rearranged too since it's being called, "Breath of the Wild vs. The Original" and I want the order to be the same. But! I'll see how it looks anyways cause you guys asked. Or at least I think it is. I wonder what you guys think. This is the thumbnail for the video this Sunday. Thoughts? He's right. https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/zhI7Kta7WOIl_J3b3iFL585BmQtu7RNSKeAthAvhbak/https/media.discordapp.net/attachments/682557469230235685/750860691941884004/passtheburrito.gif (Aside from mod) Oh! Then I'll have to add a blue role some time. Is that your favorite color? Don't like Purple? Watch Pirates of the Caribbean. Well of course there be a pirate code! I follow the pirate code! Yarg! The rich get richer! WhAt! I would never abuse those privileges.   That's my... um, least favorite thing to do. 😋 Thanks for the Burrito! I've been wanting one forever. That's a classic. Found an underrated image on the Zelda Reddit. That's me trying to remember names. I'll start using this when I see cops. Really? How so? Thank You  u/Byotic from Reddit for the idea. Ah, 5th is a good grade. To be fair, there aren't a lot of ways to say it better. I think being up front about the risks/worries of the virus can be a productive thing. They way we are realistic with our worries and think about them more critically. It's not wrong. Muh ha ha... it's fool proof. Plunder his swag points. I have conflicted feelings about these shoes. Better luck next time. Darn... He's not that big of a Youtuber. Plus, there are other servers larger than his.  Must be a bug. How? Especially if it is an outdoor cat, which mine is. Cats. They take less work keep clean. I think the cat likes it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpsGLsaZKS0 What about the hunger games mode? That's a hot take. It's also a pun. No it's not. It's art. "Daphne" Nohansen That would be slow for a TAS Don't burn anything. I'm going AFK gents.  The meme is a lot funnier in context. <:happy:725779401031024641> I still think SAO is a good show. Just not a great anime. Nah, it's a bow tie. I see the confusion though. That's glorious. Not sure if I should delete or not. 😖 That's a bad message.  I know right! It's so lifelike. 😄 Someone made a graphics comparison between Xbox One and PS4 when playing Ghost of Tsushima, but the game is only on PS4. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9uInGQl5Cc  Yah. **Family Friendly Server** Thanks for understanding. [ Redacted. Reason: Inappropriate ] Aliens? Communists? Who knows.  All we know for certain is that this is serious. I'm willing to bet there is some Mind-Control involved. This is a pandemic! Correction! That was the first DOCUMENTED garage kidnapping. 😋 Busted. I don't feel so good about this show. ^ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbDGtknEGlg It is, but I go to a Christian college so we all joke around about it. Sometimes friends on campus get together just to watch it. 😋 You're missing out. 🥒 🍅 It's been at least six months since I've last seen it. Veggietales is top notch quality. Amen Math is evil too. 😄 [Redacted for swearing] Lets not talk about meth please. This is a family friendly server. None of these are better. 😖 It's a bit dark for my taste. 🤮 Eww That was clever. 😄 What is it? Very derpy. Nice song! It's very funky in a bardic way. That's mean. <:mad:730068988301803530> Nah, it's fine. It's not your fault that Discord is bad at showing long images. That works! You could send a link instead. 🤔 I liked the caption at the bottom. 😉 Too bad spears are as weak as they are. In the sequel they need more durability. I love the Ice Spear. It's sooo helpful. No, stick is best. Oh, it should work first try. Thankfully, The ChuChu bot won't kick you if you do it multiple times. What are you AAA'ing for? 😄 Yarg! You can never have too many Korok Leaves. I made this and already regret it. I thought this was applicable since the 4th of July was yesterday. I want to try that with my cat now. 😖 Aww... Poor mouse. I'd get in to that. Amen. Yes. I want 12 of them! Questionable at least. That's dark. I saw your video from before, is it the same one? As a joke I set slowmode to 6 hours in the General chat, but when I got rid of it some people still had to wait 6 hours. What! Gosh darn it. Yah, see if that fixes it. What in the... what's wrong with Discord. You might need to reset then. I got rid of slow mode. Try it again. Everyone else can talk. Weird? You don't need to. I put it back. When I respond to comments I try to spell out full words as much as possible. But in Discord I get lazy. 😋 It's very helpful! I might use it as well.  I'm just worried that other people won't understand what it means. I had to look up what o7 is. Thanks to you I learned something today. My gym is never like that. Then again, I don't have a gym... Lucky sons of pups. Is that what it's like to go to the actual gym? 🏋️‍♂️ I've never tried using octoroc balloons before. I'll test that out next time I'm playing. I didn't think Octorock worked in any recipes. ^ This is how I feel at the beginning of my videos. 😄 The scariest of all. I'm working on one right now. It'll be ready in a few minutes. I love that format You monster! Banjo Kazooie needs more love. 😋 Me neither. Slice That makes me sad for pancakes.  What does that make bread? You forgor 💀  In the description for this channel it says "Keep is family friendly and don't **spam.**" While I appreciate how you are spacing out your promotions, we'd appreciate it if you didn't post the same video over and over again. *[Sweeps the link under the rug]*  What link.... 😄  Interesting idea for a challenge! It was fun to see how your friends and you interacted. That's a big milestone.  Thank you!  Ayy! I didn't know you were the same Chuckster. I love the work you do with your channel. Your Twilight Princess video is a personal favorite of mine. Check out please ^ Huh. Neat. <:sub:725422469027987507> As cool as it would be to get that many comments, I have my doubts. 😋 Kirb Friends for life! He has some really impressive animations. I highly recommend tuning in. I like it! No, SmallAnt different. Be respectful of creators. They put a lot of work into what they do. Not mine, but it's from friend of mine who's got a GREAT theory. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=athVixxEqQw  Well that's not tantalizing. 😋 I'll add it to my watch later list! https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/j7xrmy/who_said_horses_cant_fly_and_fall_back/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share Not mine, but Berry came up with a fun video. That thumbnail is fantastic. :D It's so well photoshopped to look natural. Ayy! I can get behind that. Seriously... this was a ton of fun to make. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJTcZoDCrdw My brother's first video. It features me! 😋  Minor Warning for Pinging unnecessarily. Especially since I was about to go to bed. No. It was just a ping in General. This is a fantastic Youtuber who makes Fake Animal Crossing Quality of Life Updates. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLqka2zD0P4 It'd be cool if we could do that. We with only 99 That's a great flag! Didn't you share a similar video a while ago? Wrong chat  Play nice. We all have different musical interests. That was truly awful. Wow. Feel the burn. 🔥 😆 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zq1j5FedJ54 This was my final for a video making class. A good friend of mine is livestreaming Zelda 1. Very cool. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K80E6bE1940  Sure! I'll add that as a rule in the channel topic https://youtu.be/AzrdsE1y0oI We can do that. https://tenor.com/view/hook-kidnapped-scorpion-boo-box-gif-8276240 Alright you little punk. You're going into the shame box too. We will toss some table scraps to you once a week. Goodbye ! https://tenor.com/view/cave-parachuting-hole-gif-19326814 Good idea! https://tenor.com/view/hook-kidnapped-scorpion-boo-box-gif-8276240 He is the Anti-Anti-Italicizer!  Send him to the box of shame! Blasphemy is outrageous, unallowed, and blasphemous! Stop spreading blasphemy or you will be banished forever!  Oh no. Why did you use Italics.  Mood. Trailers are always a blast. None needed. It's the Empire of Byzantium. We need it.  Not the first time I've heard that theory. In fact, a similar theory existed years ago before Skyward Sword released. Oh, you mean swearing. Got it. 😄 Pinging?  Yah, you can do that. 😄 We allow some abbreviations like "lmao" as long as they can explain the abbreviation with family friendly words, like I just did.  lmao stands for "laughing my armadillo off" Understandable. Yah, they had to since the Wolf Link amiibo was used to unlock it. If Skyward Sword was having a new dungeon, wouldn't Nintendo promote that? That would be a huge selling point.   I'll need to watch that. I thought SSHD was just a port. "The Legend of Zelda-Craft" I hope that Nintendo doesn't patch out all the coolest glitches at launch. Never is a long time. Thanks for the tips! Too bad I just stole it.  Also, your roll turned out FANTASTIC. I love the way it looks. It depends on the person. I just use the cheapest stuff I find at the store. Dude, I understood none of that. 😂 I also add a butt ton more sugar. Nope. Although, I do alter the recipe slightly. For instance, I add slightly more water so that it comes out softer. I don't own a stuffed animal Bite. 😢 No, I was just joking That is why it looks unreal. It is a 3d Model. I made it in blender.  Thanks yoshi! Here is the inside. Also, Bark is in the top right of the image. <:boko:810915171987357706> This is my latest loaf of bread. I used the recipe from the King Arthur bakery site. (For now) Alright. I forgive you. You stole that from the King Arthur Bakery website didn't you. 🤨 What was that? :O Also, I'm late.  Nice potatoes (jk) https://tenor.com/view/lets-get-this-bread-gif-12741835 I cannot resist. It is bread.  The man in your living room is imaginary. You have been living in a dream.  Hi hungry, I am Dad. This is seriously amazing to watch. Why is it so relaxing. Explaining all of the religion in Zelda? I could see that being interesting if done in a Bill Wurtz style. About time this game is releasing! Wow! For being several months old that pasta looks good. Hence, Distant Cousin. It is unleavened wheat in tiny strands/shells. So it's at least a distant cousin.  That sounds amazingly delicious. What on earth... 🌍  6 Hours is WAY Too long. That is fishy. Why would Blue Chuchu delete that? What was in the message?  Washing bread is cursed. How did I not see this earlier. Every crumb counts! I like how you zoomed in so we can't see the whole bread. 😄  I like many types of bread... this is not one of them. 😳 Nice! Good question! Whole Wheat bread is my go-to bread, and I love dinner rolls. But it needs more bread. Nice. It genuinely made me laugh.  That is beautiful! That's hardcore.  That canned bread doesn't look half bad to me. I'd eat it. Preach Knight! No, you make a good point. I like muffins and bread. It is a cousin of Bread. Technically pastries have flakier dough, but it's basically bread.  He makes a good point.  Now that is a soggy cookie. Ooooo! Those are nice and toasty. I like chai tea Oh no! Not boring! 😱 I'm always practicing my cursive, but it's mediocre at best. Leave it to grandmothers to have the best handwriting in the world. 😄  You have nice cursive handwriting! Hi Scarf! These bread picks are awesome today!  How did you know? I like this My name is Burton, so I like Burt toast. Burnt toast is less enjoyable. It was one of the few times I've followed a trend.  I own Animal Crossing now.  But I still don't have a Switch. Eee! Thanks! Ayy! You've been looking through some obscure stuff then. 😅  I didn't think anyone watched that video anymore. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_tfVsKTxbg&t=2s Where do you learn this art! I did a similar drawing a while ago for one my my videos. Whole Wheat. Oh dang, you went all out. This is definitely going into my pics folder.  Great job with it! That's AWESOME! You got the outfit down and everything. Holy cow!  I know the bread! Also it's encouraging. If it were making fun of gamers or bread then I'd delete it too. <:breadandbutter:722164837580537857> But she mentioned BREAD! We can be a bit relaxed with the posts here. if it involved bread it is allowed. I approved this. Me ^ https://tenor.com/view/gatto-cibo-cat-bread-hungry-cat-gif-15925702 I love the game as a whole. It would take ages to list everything. Both sound really tasty. Wah! That's a lot of caps, but I appreciate the enthusiasm. 😄 We must outlaw marshmallows! It was awkward.  Thankfully the teacher knew me well and I was able to get it back.  I got in trouble in high school for accidentally carrying a pocket knife in my trumpet case. 😂  Explanation: I used the trumpet at campfire the month before and needed the knife to make marshmallow roasting sticks. We should sue your dryer. Aw... 😁 Thanks guys. I am doomed. Wait a minute... I'M BLONDE! 😱 Well, I'm glad to know you aren't REALLY using violence. Oh! 😅 Defense is different from instigation. The Axis powers struck first, which justified the allied defense. Ideally, no one should have resorted to violence and started it. Time to rant about the punchline being ruined. 😂 I agree. That's the fault not the screenwriters. That gave Anakin and Padame weird dialogue. Padame ruins it? Why Padame? https://tenor.com/view/sith-obi-wan-falsedichotomy-gif-7708366 *You think you are pathetic and you *should* get a job That's insightful.  Happy Celebration Day! Ayy, that's not so bad. I sure hope the weekend calms everything down. Dang, sorry to hear that! Getting spammed by family members? Oh no! He is forever awake. No. Gus is amazing. That was well worth watching. Thanks for sharing Goat! 😄 Yes! https://tenor.com/view/cuteness-overload-so-cute-gif-14116092 Ah! That's too much cuteness! I think it's cute. 😍 Although I know that it sometimes attracts Squirrels. Sorry, I don't know. That's a fun pastime. My grandfather loved bird watching, and my family now has a bird feeder outside the window. My personal favorite bird is the Red Bellied Woodpecker. That's awesome! Can you identify them well? That's good to hear. Wow, that was rude Coffee. I'm sorry to hear about that Cheese. I hope you're feeling better soon.  I'll be in General Zelda if yall want me. Oh, I didn't even realize the chat we were in. I just saw a Zelda post and my video and assumed the best. 😄 I'd like to play Twilight Princess HD if it comes out for Switch. I have only done the Wii version. I find it to be similar length to other dungeons during my playthroughs, but I've also played Twilight Princess 5 times or so. I guess it depends on whether you include the Ganondorf fight as part of the dungeon. That was a standard length dungeon! Hold on... short and lame? I love it too. Hyrule Castle is a prime example of a connected dungeon. Yah, I'm sick of hearing that excuse! It's cramping my imagination. 😄 (And if anyone gives me doo-doo about lore preventing connected dungeons I'm kicking yer hindquarters off the ship!) I'm fine if Nintendo wants to keep isolated dungeons, but that shouldn't be the ONLY thing they do.  A mix of isolated and connected dungeons would be best. I'm playing Skullduggery via emulator. 😋 Amen. I'm playing Poptropica instead of doing an essay  I'm sorry for your loss. "might be because i dont upload" Well... that would do it. 😄 A prime example of fun being sacrificed for quality. 😋  (Although I still enjoyed is slightly) That's true. 😅  With my latest Short Film, it was tedious to collect footage. Yet, because I took time with recording, it made the video look better. (2 Hours or so for a 1 minute video) That makes sense to me! (Easy and Enjoyable) Things you like --------- Things the Audience likes (Professional Looking and consistent) So you are saying it is a balancing act? I had lots of fun on Youtube, even though I didn't get to 100 subs. BUT! I understand the drive to get an audience. Nobody likes to make stuff that is unseen. ^ That was my strategy for 8 years. 😄 Man, I got to get rid of this chat. 😅 No fight here. I agree. If Mario 64 gets released this year than hopefully you can play it. It's a classic. Yah. Only a communist would give that answer. Commies. I adjusted the channel description. I am hungry, so I'm going to get food. This conversation made me laugh. 😄 I love you guys. Water is wet due to being a highly fluid liquid that soak things. I think it all depends on the state of the buns.  If connected: Taco If Disconnected: Sandwich Are hot dogs a type of taco, or sandwich? True, this is probably just a copy and paste scam without any real threat. On the other hand, I'd rather be safe than sorry by avoiding sketchy people. You sure like changing your nickname don't you? 😆  I like the reference. It's clever. Oh gosh! Of course not. I appreciate that you're looking out for our server. I am simply skeptical of the validity of this message. For starters, it randomly starts talking about  different user half-way through the message.  potatotailbaka07 -> SirTZN.  Additionally, it makes a point of sending it to literally everyone you know.  I don't know, that looks a bit like a spam chain message. Because the world is full of evil people. I agree, it is wrong and disturbing.   Thank you for sharing so we can be up-to-date on the situation. Good idea. Those are some really fun ones! As an American I also like looking into the Civil War and the Boer War.  Which wars?  History is a passion of mine since it's like story telling except it really happened.  I am!  Congrats you obtained the Warning 1 role.  That was due to the Vikings i believe. The story is heard is that they wanted to trick settlers into going to Greenland even though the land is worse than it is in Iceland. Not sure if it's true or not.  Yes since it's a form of spam and it is in the Deep Conversation chat.  Please stop spamming random words without context. I agree. It spell checked the name Lior  Ayy Lior! Well, it's difficult to understand what you're saying unless you do. Could you use complete sentences?  Because it is about a dark situation. Was it from before you read the article? So, what was the question mark for? Then don't randomly message question marks.  If you need an explanation for what This Field is Required posted, it's a petition for action to be taken against a professor that sexually abused his students.  What confuses you? Okay, sure buddy... 🙄 What? Seriously. As in Power Points? What? We were getting a little philosophical.  Maybe this would be better? I see it now. Nice to have you back Jcross. Opps, Sorry Burrito. I accidentally deleted your message when I tried to delete my gif. That is a deep thing to say I'm with my bro on this one. It was an Italian Trench. 😄 https://tenor.com/view/mindblown-amazed-explosion-space-omg-gif-10279314 A matter of prespective Hopefully they're still humaniod and not animal-like. The reason I haven't made a video about that yet is because it's an over used video format.  Think about all the Top 10 Enemies for BotW2 videos out there. 🤔 That is a good point! My personal suggestions when it comes to enemy variety in BotW2 are... - Skulltula  - Deku Babas (Serpent and Big Variety included)  - Stalfos - Darknuts - Bulblins. That seems to be a larger problem than just "Guardians are too weak". I believe the same argument could be said of all the other  monsters/bosses in Hyrule. To be honest with you, I am not sure how that could be fixed unless Nintendo... A) Nerfed Late-Game Link (Not advised) B) Made a Higher Tier of Guardian (Which might be cool, but also feels like a band-aid approach) Ideally, Nintendo would make a game mode where Guardians could feel more powerful without being bullet sponges, but I have serious doubts Nintendo will go through with that. You know what, I now that I think about it, this could make a good free-form video. I'll add it to my journal. 😉 When I first finished Twilight Princess the same thing happened to me.  I was so confused! I ended up googling if I did anything wrong only to find out it was intentional. Clearly, making a post game it tricky, but I would love to see Nintendo go the extra mile. Very much! > what about after fighting ganon? cause when i defeated ganon, my game launched at my last save  That is a problem all Zelda games have had. I'd love if Nintendo fixed it though. Yah, I'm not psyched about the crying Bread, but the grumpy one I have a plan for. It won't be a copy and paste of the image, but it will be interesting.  Recommended what?  Later! No guarantees!  Sure, but it might not happen. That's crazy enough that it might just work. 😁  When I get back from vacation I'll look into making those emotes. I've played a lot of master mode, but to be honest I prefer normal difficulty. Master Mode enemies are too spongey for my liking. 😋 Not quite the right chat. Whoops. Hmmm... I don't have an answer It's a predicament since it's... a) 1:00 in the morning so there isn't a lot to do b) We're bored and want something to do. No problem. Well, the Steam summer sale is going on. There's bound to be a cheap game you like right? But that can't really help in this situation I find that I sleep better if I workout during that day. That way I get tired before 11. I'm the president in Civilization 4. Or am I a dictator? Its a skill that takes decades to master. 😝  Sleeping is a good thing.  Legos are awesome. I used to have a lot of Indiana Jones sets.  But you have the entire internet at your disposal! You could learn something new, watch something funny, make content, develop a skill. The possibilities are endless! Okay, so I know this is a super "dad" thing to say, but...  Boring people typically do boring things. Just do something that doesn't bore you. ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯ I believe so I don't blame yah. Thankfully you can buy a new shield. 😅  Ouch 😖 I think giving shields more surfing durability would help as well. That way it doesn't discourage the player from surfing as much. Cooking was phenomenal.   That's really clever! I like how you related the weapon crafting system too the cooking system.  It would be a great way to give minerals more purpose as well! 😎 👌 No joke, the director of Link's Crossbow Training wanted him to have a rifle originally. Amen boss. Time Zones, darn. It would be on Youtube. I do want to stream on Discord later today though! I definitely want to! But I want to do a few livestreams first so that I know how everything works. That reminds me of one of my old theory videos! The one where where i tried to figure out Zelda U's title. :D Theory Video: BotW is Illuminati Propaganda Q: Hey Bread, out of the Resistance of Telma’s Bar (Twilight Princess) which member is your favorite? Mine is either the one from Ordon Village or the one you meet at Snowpeak.  A: I like Shad for his outfit! He might be stuck up, but he's got style. Q: am i the only one who love the lorule castle theme  A: Nope! I think it's a really cool theme too. Q: Favorite cheese  A: Pepper Jack. I'm lactose intolerant, but whenever there's pepper jack I'm still gonna eat it. Q: What is your favorite divine beast(counting the blight Ganon and quest that goes with it)?  A: I like Vah Naboris too! It has a fun mini-dungeon leading up to the main dungeon, the structure of the dungeon is unique, and the boss was a decent challenge. Q: is.it.december.27.yet.in.america.   A: Aye! Q: Which one's better?  A: Forsaken Fortress since it has more of the elements of a classic Zelda dungeon. The Yiga Hideout also feels small. Q: what kind of car do you have  A: I don't own a car, but I sail a sloop. Q: what made you think of the Roleplay Idea?  A: Oh, that wasn't roleplay. That really happened. The parrot when evil, trapped me in the brig, it was killed by poisoned crackers, and I was freed and got an identical parrot to the last one.

A: I do now! Q: Do you like drawing  A: I like to doodle in my college notebooks, but don't draw any other time. As you can tell from my older videos, I'm rusty at it. Q: Question for bread: ++++[++++>---<]>+.[--->+<]>+++.[--->+<]>-----.--[->++++<]>+.----------.++++++.-[---->+<]>+++.-[--->++<]>+.+++.+.++++++++.+[---->+<]>++.--[->++++<]>-.+[->+++<]>.-------.--[--->+<]>-.[---->+<]>+++.---[->++++<]>.------------.+.++++++++++.+[---->+<]>+++.---[->++++<]>-.++[->+++<]>++.+[--->+<]>+++.------.  A: 😳  Q: Which one do you like more; DLC Pack 1 or 2? (For botw)   A: The first one! Master Mode and the Trials were a ton of fun. Q: Favorite champion?  A: Link!  Q: Do you put milk before the cereal, like a normal person?   A: Refer to the meme above.  Q: Cereal before milk you sociopath  A: Exactly! Q: So I’m not the only one that enjoys the game on easy and normal lol phew 😅  A: You are in good company! Q: what do you think about the whole "war on christmas"  A: That's a fascinating question! I have not done research on the topic, but I see no problem with the phrase "Happy Holidays" vs "Merry Christmas". For instance, sometimes I shorten the phrase "Merry Christmas and Happy New Year" into just "Happy Holidays!" I am sure there are people who say "Happy Holidays" to spite Christians, but I think they are a minority.  I agree, there is an overemphasis on materialism at Christmas time, but that is a separate issue.  Q: on a scale of 1 to 10, how hard were the master sword trials?  A: It's been almost 4 years since I played them, but I remember them being a fair challenge in Normal Mode. In Master Mode I'm sure they are a 9/10. Q: What is your favorite shrine  A: The shrines with Overworld Mazes before them. It makes them feel like real dungeons. Q: What game mode do you play on for most games? easy, normal or hard?  A: Normal. It's somewhat challenging and doesn't require endless grinding. Q: ummmm what's happening here?? it's a long time since I logged in and now the whole server's so different  A: During the holidays we host  Q-n-A. It gives the moderators a break and spices things up. Q: Hello when will bread answer our questions?   A: Now! Q: thoughts on the cessna 210? A: If it flies, then it's good. If it not, then it's a really big, but sleek paperweight.  Q: How did u come up with the name "bread pirate"? Merry Xmas!  A: I love answering this one! Unfortunately, the story's a bit long winded so I'll leave a link to my FAQ where I answered it... https://docs.google.com/document/d/15-uB8X1wzngp3cQcz1DSRQ-aNoQa031x-81T23lWxYg/edit#bookmark=id.kiwt31opyo2v Q: What is your favorite non Legend of Zelda game?  A: I'm going to give a different answer that earlier and say Applewood, the 2D Indie Platformer made by a guy who inspired me as a Youtuber. Q: Merry Christmas  A: Thanks Swamp!  Q: What is the first Zelda game you ever played?  A: Twilight Princess! I was only 11 at the time so I had to sneak the game through the check-out aisle without my parents looking at the age rating. 🐱‍👤 Q: what’s your favorite boss fight in any video game? A: I had a Batman Plug-n-Play with a Joker fight in the first story. Here's a link if you're interested. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swmp79XqBwU (The fight starts at 30:40) I died a LOT of times and needed help from an older kid who was visiting my house. Q: whats the hardest game you have played?  A: I don't play hard games as often as I used too. In the past I did lots of hardcore Minecraft runs and always set my games to HARD difficulty, but recently I've found I enjoy games when they're at normal or easy difficulty. The hardest game I've done is probably Zelda II. Q: Favorite non-holiday/birthday day of the year?  A: That's awfully specific. I guess I'd have to answer, the last day of school.  Q: 2 questions, how would you rate cheese :)?  A: I rate cheese 9/10 because it tastes great but I am lactose intolerant. Q: I got hungry 😋  A: Mood!  Q: Random suggestion: we should add a bread ranking channel. js  A: Yah, like Lior said we worked on a code for that. Not sure how much of it is finished though. Q: What did you get for Christmas?   A: A memory foam mattress, a zen garden, a plush Link doll, and a bread maker! Q: I already asked that  A: That's okay! It means I can answer two questions for the price of one. Q: How old were you when you stopped believing in Santa? & why?  A: That's a silly question. Of course he's real! Q: Merry Christmas  A: Thanks Trigg! Q: What do you think of the Water Temple (of the grown-up part)? Are you part of the rare ones to like it ?  A: It was the most frustrating dungeon in OoT, but I didn't hate it THAT much. The concept is cool, it's just that the rooms are too similar. If there was more variety between floors then it'd be easier. (I was playing on the N64 version, but the same goes for the 3d Remake. A color change isn't enough.) Q: What is your favorite gimmick from any 3d Zelda game?  A: The time travel from OoT and Majoras Mask. It didn't feel out-of-place in the world and created fun new quests. An example of a gimmick that feels out-of-place is the Twili, they look like black and white squid aliens in a fantasy medieval world.  Q: Is OOT N64 or OOT3D better in your opinion?  A: Haven't played the 3D version yet. I've only played the classic. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Q: Is it pronounced jif or gif?  A: I say Gif. Q: Py, Js, Kt, Go, C#, or Java which one?   A: I'll take C# since it looks like a piano note. Q: which race in Legend of Zelda is your favorite  A: Probably the Hylians. It might seem like a boring answer, but Hylians come in many shapes and sizes so the limitations are endless. Q: What did you do.  A: I did nothing. I'm innocent!! Q: Shut down the server again.  A: OH! Right... I did do that. Q: What are your top 3 Zelda games?  A: I can't decide! All the Zelda games are special in one way or another. Took a break from Discord for Christmas, so I'll get to them around lunch tomorrow. I see then! Q: how, if your interested, do you feel about the new fnaf game. It’s popping up a lot on my YT recommendations so I’m wondering if you’ve been interested  A: I'll only answer the first one since we're limiting people to 1 question per day. I think it looks promising and is a fun twist on the formula. Not sure of much else since I haven't seen the game for myself. Q: What is your favorite sword in breath of the wild  A: Technically, we have a 1 question per day limit, but this question is too good not to answer. I ADORE the travelers sword. Even though it has awful stats, it matches my outfit and doesn't stand out like other swords. Q: When can I get another pack of crackers? A: Of COURSE! 🫓  Q: Py, Js, Kt, Go, C#, or Java which one?   A: You'll need to wait until tomorrow to get your answer! Q: Dragon or Snail?  A: Dragon!  Q: Are you planning on continuing the Breath of the Wild Relics of the Past run?  A: Ah... err... **pass**. Next question! Q: What is better will u or switch?  A: The Wii U is better for playing old Zelda games, the Switch is better for playing BotW on. Q: Whats your favorite Legend of Zelda boss?  A: Ook the Monkey King! I love that he has a character arc and helps for the dungeon boss. The King Bulblin is also tied. Q: What's your favorite Zelda enemy (not boss or mini boss)?  A: Bulblins or Bokoblins. Both are similar and both are great. Q: What other games do you like besides The Legend of Zelda  A: At the moment, I've been playing lots of Minecraft, Assassin's Creed Unity, and Animal Crossing New Horizons. Q: Will you have a merry Christmas?  A: Tough to say. My Merry-o- Meter is acting up again so I'll need to buy a new one to measure the amount of merry I'm having. Q: Is there coming a general section in your discord?  A: Well yes, but actually no! Q: What is your favorite part of OoT?  A: The Music and Aesthetic. I think the game creates the perfect atmosphere for a Zelda experience.  Q: why?  A: Why not? Q: Do you watch any Christmas movies in that time if you did, what’s your favorite? A: *It's a Wonderful Life* is a classic that my family watches every year. I tear up every time I watch it. A: What?  Q: Lior, you already asked a question yesterday. I can't answer that. **Round 1** Q: Will you 1v1 me in tetris?  A: Nope! Because you will absolutely destroy me at it. 😂 Q: Thoughts on Cessna 177?  A: Actually I prefer the Cessna 172 cause they had a version call "Cutlass." Q: what made you want to become a youtuber? A: Seeing other Youtubers having fun with Lets Plays and skits! I also dreamed of being famous... but I was only 10 when I started so that wasn't happening. 😅 Q: What did you get for Christmas?  A: Pending... I'll get back to you on that. Q: You like jazz?  A: I LOVE Jazz. I listen to it all the time whether it's smooth, ragtime, swing, ballroom, or dixieland.  Q: What’s your favorite indie game?  A: A Hat In Time! It's so cute. 🥰 Q: Could you do Zelda game challenge mode play thru, playing through a selected Zelda game with a strict set of rules, like only using a stick or a single shield  A: Not in the near future since I'm focused on Fun Facts. But in the distant future, anything is possible. Q: Again?  A: Yes? Q: Do you like the wii u gamepad for BOTW?  A: I did! I found it intuitive and sturdy. The motion puzzles were annoying with it, but not enough to rip hair out. Q: I don’t really have a question. I just want to wish you the best and merry Christmas!  A: Merry Christmas to you too! 🎄  Q: who is your favourite sage from OoT?  A: That's a toughie. I'll have to say Rauru because I like him as the owl. Q: When are next mod demotions? Asking for a friend  A: Never. Mods are forced to remain mods for **life.** Q: What’s your favorite piece of Zelda lore?  A: The BS Zelda Game: Ancient Stone Tablets has a lot of lore I love. I believe it should be canon. Q: What's your opinion on wagyu beef  A: Never had it, but it looks yummy! Q: Can we keep this channel after tomorrow?  A: Well yes, but actually no. Q: What is the easiest video you’ve made?  A: The second video on my channel! It is called "look for the bear" Q: If you're channel wasn't Zelda ,then what would it be  A: I think I mentioned this in my FAQ, but my original plan for The Bread Pirate channel was to make Hardcore-One-Life-Challenge Lets Plays. However, the only hardcore lets play I've done was on Zelda II. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z3J5BsfOvQ&list=PLmWFiszEHip7wczcGgD0yarwMDIktbrnh Q: What was the best gift you have ever received?  A: Salvation from Jesus Christ.  Q: Is it Monday yet?  A: Yes! Q: Do you think WW and TP will get remastered on the Switch?  A: My uncle does not work at Nintendo, so I have no idea. Q: Who is joe mama?   A: A mom named Joe. Q:  if you had to put a level or dungeon or something like that from one zelda into another what would it be? (For me it’s SS silent realms in botw)  A: The Forest Temple from Twilight Princess would have been awesome to explore in Breath of the Wild! Imagine how cool it would be to paraglide from trees that big. Q:  if you were to create a channel on a different topic what might it be?  A: Nothing. I'm happy with the text channels we have. 😊 Thanks for being patient everybody! I was supposed to unlock the server this morning, but I got busy. I can answer the last few questions in an hour or two and unlock the server for everybody. Q: (the "pun" is a boob joke btw)  A: Oh! Well that's why I was confused. A pun is a joke that deals with a play on words. This is a visual joke. Q: Favorite holiday?  A: Can't say for certain. Probably Christmas. Q: Favorite mario game?  A: You were five hours too late. Yoshi asked that in a question above. 😂  Q: since this is QNA, why do people celebrate Hunnaka or Christmas? Idk y since their both Christian Holidays and I’m celebrating both! Lol  A: That is a huge historical question. I'll give a brief answer: Hanukkah is in honor of the recovery of Jerusalem and subsequent rededication of the Second Temple at the beginning of the Maccabean revolt in 200 B.C. (Taken from Wikipedia). Christmas is in honor of the birth of Jesus in 0 A.D.. We actually based the calendar off of his birth! That's why AD means "Year of our Lord". Culturally speaking, we celebrate these holidays because of the traditions passed down. Q: Opinion on pickled herring?  A: You can cut down the mightest tree in the forest with a herring! <:Fishy:722164604595077253> I like them. Q: pirates 🏴‍☠️ or space ✨  A: *Why not both?* Q: Who is favorite Champion  A: The Champion Leon of the Galar Region Q: What is your opinion on kenya?  A: Don't know much about it, but I know where it is on the map! Q: [Three Links chugging down liquid]  A: Mood. Q: Did everyone have a great Thanksgiving?  A: I DID! I spent lots of time with family. Q: what is your favorite song and/or genre of music?  A: Favorite song at the moment is "I'm gonna sit right down and right myself a letter" by Fats Waller. I listen to all sorts of genres (as you know). Jazz, Swing, Orchestra, Video Game and Movie Soundtracks, Civil War Marching Music, Sea Shanties, and recently some pop music by Taylor Swift (as suggested to me by a friend) but that last one isn't my typical expertise.  Q: what is your favorite mario game?  A: New Super Mario Bros Wii is my favorite multiplayer Mario Game. Mario Galaxy is my favorite single player Mario game. Q: what is your opinion on anchovy pizza?  A: I've eaten it twice for my birthday party. I regretted it both times.  Q: and Bread Pirate, what would your ideal companion character (think navi, midna, etc.) in your ideal zelda game be like?  A: Unlike most people, I liked Navi! She fits the role well as a fairy and she has a cute personality. If they gave her some more dialogue and variation in her sound effects she'd be my ideal character. Midna is a great companion too, but she hogs the spot light. Sometimes it feels like Link is HER companion and we're just escorting her to the next story point. **Round 5** Q: Once the rest of the server is back, could you make a channel that doesn’t have a topic, and is just for whatever? It’s annoying to have your message or image deleted because you forgot what channel you were in  A: That's called general. 😂  Q: favorite animal?  A: Cow. They looks so cute!! 🐮  Q: have you seen the movie Scott Pilgrim V.S. The World or read the Scott Pilgrim comics?  A: Nope, but they sound familiar. 🤔  Q: Dont ping him, let him answer it when he can  A: It's alright if they ping! I don't mind. 😊  Q: If you can create ANY monster and get it in botw 2 what would the monster look like or if you don’t wanna draw, how difficult would the monster be 1 through 10  A: I would love to see bulblins return! They were in Twilight Princess. But if you want an original monster, it'd be fun to see pirate bokoblins! That would spice up the seas. (Difficulty Level: Average) Q: where do you think is the worst place in BOTW?  A: In BotW, the oceans were boring. As a pirate I think they need the most improvements. Q: Bread how long do you think your channel will last?  A: That is a legitimate question! My plan is to continue making Zelda content for as long as I can come up with ideas. After that, I could make a new channel for a different topic. Some creators try to branch out, but I am unsure I want to do that. So to answer your question: Several more years at least. Q: ehe  A: heh  Q: joe Candice ligma  A: That would be an unfortunate name for someone. What kind of sick parents name their kid "Joe Candice Ligma" Q: What do you think of the “Gerudo-outfit-Link-with-two-hydromelons” pun  A: I didn't know that was a pun, I thought it was a boob joke. 😂 🍈🍈 (Not trying to be inappropriate, but pointing it out.) Thanks for the save! Q: Are you a fan of motion controls in BOTW?  A: I think Motion Controls can be SUPER fun when done well. Consider Wii Sports/Wii Sports Resort, those games are timeless. But Zelda has a bad track record with motion controls for a few reasons: (1) The motion controls usually feel laggy. (Ex. Skyward Sword, and BotW Puzzles) (2) The motion controls puzzles involve fine movements, even though the controls are inaccurate. (Ex. Roll Goal Mini Game from Twilight Princess) (3) It seems like most Zelda players aren't interested in swinging their arms IRL. They want to relax and play the game without breaking immersion with the screen. Personally, I loved the motion controls in Twilight Princess since they felt quick and didn't involve fine movements (aside from the vile Roll Goal.) BotW's motion controls on the other hand, feel like they were tacked on at the last minute. The only motion controls in the game I *liked* were the ability to aim in first-person.  Pretty much all the questions you guys have given me have been really fun! So I don't know why I'd be tired of them. Q: could you make a hanukkah pic channel if enough people do it?  A: Actually, it would be fun to have a holiday pictures channel! I'll consider that. Q: Do you have any bread themed facts? A: Did You Know: During the Napoleonic Wars, Russian Bakers left under-cooked bread for French soldiers to eat. They did this so that the soldiers would get sick and fight in worse condition. Q: Mac or Windows (or Linux?)  A: I've been using Windows since I was 5. I do use Mac for some college work, but it feels unnatural to me. I always have to change the placement of the CTRL and CMD key in settings. 😂  Q: Actually I typed it out  A: I am sorry for your loss. **Round 4** Q: i meant what is your favorite brand of white bread?  A: In that case I have no idea! Can I say that Homemade White Bread is my favorite? Q: Wait bread hasn’t done all 136 shrines? I’ve got half a mind to outright leave the server.  A: Oof. Q: Bread! Comon! Do the champions ballad! It is the most Wholesome thing you will ever see! And as you know… the reward is the coolest thing ever!  A: Someday! But there is no rush. 😁  Q: bread, how do you make white bread?  A: I follow this recipe: https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/the-easiest-loaf-of-bread-youll-ever-bake-recipe But this winter I want to try new recipes. Q: How much shrine are in botw?  A: 120 in the base game. There are 136 if you include the DLC. Q: What pets do you have?  A: My family has many pets since we own a small farm! We have one dog, 8 cows, 3 Chickens, a rooster, a white old cat, and a younger cat named Yoshi who has featured on my personal channel!  Q: what is your opinion on cuccos?  A: They are plotting to overthrow the bourgeois farmers.  Q: Will the server go on vacation for Xmas too?  A: Probably? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Q: Are you getting fed up with these questions yet?  A: Nope. Q: What's the easiest way to get demoted?  A: Ask to retire. 🤣 Q: Who’s your tf2 main.  A: That is a tough one to answer since I swap between almost all the classes. At the moment, I lean towards Demoman, Scout, and Medic... but engie used to be by main. Q: will you be taking part in hanukkah  A: As a Christian I've never considered celebrating Hanukkah, but maybe I should since it celebrates something important to both faiths! Q: will you take pics A: Probably not. I don't take very many pictures. 😅 Q: Did you read one piece?  A: Nope.  Q: Real quick One Piece if you try to read it I will be 100 years old bc it to long  A: Thank you for the warning! I have a busy schedule so I will probably skip One Piece for now. Q: Not really I've read it(caught up now) and it does not in fact take 100 years(not even close) But Mr bread is really busy with college. A: Too be fair, there are 100 volumes in the manga. If you buy one a year then it really WILL take you 100 years. **Round 3** Q: Must be really hard not to envy your cousins when they have video games long before you do.  A: Not anymore! Not I am the one who gets gams before them. 😁 Q: How much did you do in BotW completion wise?  A: I beat the game a few times, including the divine beasts, but will never do every shrine or korok seed. The process takes way too long. I also haven't completed the Champion's Ballad DLC, but I do want to complete that one someday. Q: What’s your favorite side quest from BotW? (And Trading Quest) A: Huh, haven't thought of that before. Maybe it's the one where you find the secret Gerudo Club! That one makes me feel sneaky. The OoT trading quest for the biggoron sword is my favorite at this point. Q: Have you ever heard the tragedy of Darth Plaugus the wise? A: Unfortunately no. It's not a tale that the Zelda community would tell. Q: You know any advanced botw combat? A: I know lots of moves, but I'm not skilled enough to pull them off. 😅 Q: What is your favorite Zelda game?  A: I'll send you a link to the FAQ section I wrote on it! It's a complicated question for me: https://docs.google.com/document/d/15-uB8X1wzngp3cQcz1DSRQ-aNoQa031x-81T23lWxYg/edit#bookmark=id.anoxb9iyd9cx Q: What is your favorite kind of white bread? And yes there are different kinds?  A: What do you mean by types? All White Bread is made from the same basic components. The differences in white bread recipes is pretty small. If you are referring to the types of*uses* for white bread, then I'd say toast. Q: Whats your major/minor in college?  A: I am a double major in History and Marketing Communications! I am doing history because I love it, and communications because I want to get a job. 😂 Q: Bread, what is ur opinion on fortnite, I enjoy it but I want ur opinion  A: I tried playing it when it first got popular, but my internet was too slow to play. Didn't return to it after that so I can't say much about it. Honestly, it seems like fun. I don't understand the hate for it. Q: If you could only eat one kind of bread for the next say, 20 years, what would it be?  A: White bread. It's used in the most things! Q: What are some difficulties in making a YT channel?  A: Figuring out how to advertise the videos you make for a channel is difficult! You have to study how other Youtubers do it and learn from their mistakes/successes. That goes for thumbnails and titles especially. Q: Good Morning! (=  A: Good afternoon! Q: Will this qna channel stay after Thanksgiving?  A: Haven't thought that far ahead. But I think it would be fun to archive it until the next time we use it (maybe Christmas). Q: What’s your favorite food of thanksgiving?  A: Dinner Rolls. 😋 Q: What do you after you finished breath of the wild 18 times?  A: Play a different game. 😂  Q: What are your favourite games outside of nintendo.  A: Well Mr Spamton, I have just the link for you! I answered this question on my FAQ. Hope you enjoy: https://docs.google.com/document/d/15-uB8X1wzngp3cQcz1DSRQ-aNoQa031x-81T23lWxYg/edit#bookmark=id.yhzgs7et72y Q: at what time will you answer the questions each day?  A: I'm kinda making it up as I go. Sometimes it's the morning, sometimes it's the afternoon. Q: How are you doing?  A: Great! I am having a great time being with my family for the week. Q: just wanted to say happy DB cooper day to everyone  A: Nice! Q: have you voted for metroid dread as GOTY yet?  A: Yes! Q: Who wants some free (but paying me is optional)  A: ME! (If only I had Switch Online yet.) Q: What has gotten you to play Nintendo stuff?  A: I had cousins who ALWAYS got the latest video games years before I did. They convinced me to get a Wii and Twilight Princess. Q: What’s your best method to fixing joy-con drift? A: Don't have drift yet, but you should use the cardboard method. It sounds like it works well. (Continued since Discord has a word limit) Q: Do you “collect” (play) with LEGOs, if so which type (eg LEGO City) is your Favorite and can you name your Favorites (that you have and that you want) A: I used to, but then I found out they are SUPER expensive. I love the Indiana Jones and Pirate sets. Q: What are you doing for Thanksgiving?  A: Spending time with family and working on an animation project for college. Fun stuff! Q: Do you have any pets? A: My family has many pets since we own a small farm! We have one dog, 8 cows, 3 Chickens, a rooster, a white old cat, and a younger cat named Yoshi who has featured on my personal channel!  Q: What movie do you think is the funniest? A: I love Ferris Bueller's Day Off! It has a clever sense of humor. Q: What game do you have the most hours on? A: I know this seems sacrilegious, but it think Team Fortress 2. I have played it off and on for 5 years so I have 500 hours on it. Q: happy thanksgiving!  A: You too! Q: What is the hardest video you’ve worked on?  A: That is an AWESOME question! I think it was the Zeltik Documentary I did. That video required weeks of research and getting an interview with Zeltik was difficult to say the least. My video about BotW Vs The Original Legend of Zelda was also time consuming, so that is a runner-up. Q: What theory or idea that you've seen on the server in regards to BOTW or it's sequel to you like the most?  A: I love this theory that Ganon tainted Link's arm to prevent him from using the Master Sword: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxEY_bfWh2Y&t=490s It is made by a smaller content creator I watch all the time.  I don't dislike any theories, but the Zonai theories seem overblown. ```Round Two!``` Q: My question is: Why is Lior mod?  A: Because he joined the server very early into it's creation, has lots of experience with bots, and is an all around cool guy. 😁 Q: What do you think about the upcoming Zelda game?  A: I hope Zelda is in it. It was fun to play as him in BotW. Q: Bread what do you think of club penguin?  A: I only played it for a short time, but I thought it was fun! It's cool that they eventually tipped the iceberg. Q: There's an app on the wii u that's "activity" or something, it has a 3d bar graph as the icon. If you go into it, find the game in the date, you can then select the game and it'll tell you how much time you've spent on it. It's a bit clunky, the Switch method is better, but it at least exists.  A: I did NOT know that! I'll need to check someday if it works for my Wii U. Q: Bread what is your favorite food?  A: The first word of the question you wrote. Q: Why did you start YouTube?  A: Here's a link to an FAQ article I wrote about it! Hope you enjoy: https://docs.google.com/document/d/15-uB8X1wzngp3cQcz1DSRQ-aNoQa031x-81T23lWxYg/edit#bookmark=id.66owu7ezk62 Q: What is your opinion on chickens?  A: They are cute as chicks, smelly as adults, and tasty in my tummy.  Q: I was wondering this myself, but what’s your favorite champion (not Link) and Devine Beast (not with the dungeon but just in general)  A: The CHAMPION LEON! And Wolf Link (Which is called a Divine Beast by Midna). Q: What is your Favorite Zelda Boss and which Boss do you consider the Hardest Zelda Boss. A: I enjoy battling Ganondorf in all his games, and the hardest for me has been Helmet Head in Zelda II.  ▸ Sorry, I don't like it either. 😋  ▸ Bread Stuffed Turkey Sounds AWESOME!  ▸ The server got nuked like a TV Dinner in the microwave. 😄  ▸ I started learning baking this summer and know how to make white bread! My favorite type to eat is whole wheat.  ▸ I have played a lot of Zelda games, but have only beaten a few. Here are the ones I've beaten.  Twilight Princess, Ocarina of Time, Almost Majoras Mask (kept having controller issues), Zelda 1, Skyward Sword, A Link to the Past, Four Swords Adventures, and Breath of the Wild. (Also I have not played Xenoblade yet, but have always wanted to play it! Maybe I'll get the remaster for the Switch.)  ▸ Thanks for the bread! And yes, you must suffer for 6 HOURS!!! 😈  ▸ I like the Cessna 182P.  It has a nice color scheme!  ▸ I have not played Halo yet, but I hear it is good.  ▸The catchphrase "storming the castle" is a quote from Miracle Max in the Princess Bride, my favorite movie ever!  ▸The next video might be about a glitch I discovered in BotW, or a fun fact about the CDI games. I'm swamped with college right now so expect a new video mid-December. ▸No idea! I played a lot on the Wii U which doesn't track hours well. If I had to take a guess, it'd be ~250 Hours. Not nearly as many hours as some people. ▸I'm going to guess you bet 2 Slices?  ▸ Here is a chain! ⛓  ▸ Check announcements!  ▸ The first is getting involved in a land war in Asia. The second is going against a Sicilian when death is on the line. The third is getting involved in politics.  ▸ Nope! I don't mind it when people ping me. In fact, I like it since it helps me know when I am wanted in a conversation on the server. Just don't DM me incessantly.   ▸ Thanks! I hope you are doing well too! Just drink some maple syrup and call it a day. Actually this is really awful timing for me since I have to go to sleep, but I'll respond to everyone's questions tomorrow morning! 😴 Probably not anytime soon. But someday! Muh ha ha ha!!! It begins. Lighten-up. It's just an internet tag. 😄 Why not make his day. Thanks for the help   And thanks for the input . Ah! interesting. What's the max amount of characters? -r Hey Riptide! It's Bread here. All our mod positions are filled right now, so we can't take you on the team.  However, you certainly have done a great job being active and helping the server. So, instead, we're giving you ! (Which makes you the first person to get the role in nearly a year.) Very good, then that settles it!  From this point forward, mods can give the  Role to people. Alright, we can dig up the ole, "Trusted Member Role" and use that. Any suggestions on what the criteria for the role should be?  But I we want to reward people for being consistently active, right? -r Hey Riptide! It's Bread here. All our mod positions are filled right now, so we can't take you on the team.  However, you certainly have done a great job being active and helping the server. So, instead, we're giving you a custom role!  From now on, you are the SUPER DUPER official conversation starter. 😄 It might not be a mod role, or have any new abilities, but it sure as heck looks nice on a username. Thanks for letting us know you're willing to help! I'll get to this later today. Strike. The last picture is blatantly against the rules.  Good call. We don't want spam account on here. https://tenor.com/view/ace-attorney-phoenix-wright-objection-capcom-gif-20965907 **A Small Rules Reminder** Politics are discouraged on the server. If you would like to discuss the situation in the Ukraine, we will not stop you. But, we encourage you to use Direct Messages with each other. That way the moderators don't need to moderate misinformation. @everyone Just to make the rules more clear. **Small Rules Update** We adjusted rule #2 and #6  **Rule 2:** Before: *Listen to .

Thanks for taking part in the QnA, I hope your holidays when great! @everyone 🎄❄ **Merry Christmas... Shutting down the server again!** 🎁 Just like Thanksgiving Week, we are closing the server! All channels will be private except  where you can send 1 question a day about anything you want and I will answer! Only 1 question! I'll ignore extra questions. The server will return on the morning of the 27th. @everyone https://twitter.com/ThePirateBread/status/1469174930096984065 https://twitter.com/ThePirateBread/status/1469175393299095553 🏴‍☠️ **Server is Back** 🍞 Thanks to everyone who participated in the Q&A event!  @everyone 🦃 🌽 **Server Vacation Mode!** 🥳 The server will be back Monday after Thanksgiving. @everyone The Switch went down in price in the UK. Time to immigrate! Oh right. We need the bread rating.  Gotta rate that bread! Big Sad ^ **Announcement:** Due to Lior's persuasive arguments (and bread bribes) we have added a  channel.  Now yall can stop yapping about Muck in . 😂 @everyone Dude, that's 5 U.S. Dollars. 😂 Welcome out latest .... He's been a part of the server since the first week and has proven to be mature. So lets all give him a warm welcome. 🥰  @everyone https://tenor.com/view/wait-a-minute-steve-harvey-steve-on-watch-wait-a-second-wait-a-sec-gif-16746965 ~ The Bread Pirate approves this message ^ ~ Alright then.

(Fun Fact: His skit about Emulation inspired a similar skit in my BS Zelda video.) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZvvxzixL9Y Hit me up in the general chat if you have. *Terranigma*... have any of you heard of this game? 😐 @everyone Reminder, this is a family friendly server. Don't joke about suicide, drugs, or sex.  Thanks again to the 's for volunteering their time. Be nice to them. They're trying to help. @everyone https://tenor.com/view/oh-no-oh-no-anyway-gif-18887547 I think this video was bound to happen. @everyone  😂 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDkgyGDnfpM Happy Birthday Lior!

We are eternally thankful to the heroic Chcken Pirate for saving us from the insidious GIF of days past.  <:Triforce:827281632755056660>  is privated. It was becoming a spam pit. 😅  This summer when I have more time I'd love to come back to the ideas and improve the server. New Emote. <:old:812790127364931585> <:Cucco:812338328040505417> **SPOILER ALERT** @everyone  I hear there are Nintendo Direct leaks on social media.  DO NOT post them here of I'm gonna ban yer butt. <:boko:810915171987357706> In celebration for 10K Subs and for our latest video I made a new emote for the server... ~ **BREAD PIRATE SERVER UPDATE** ~ @everyone  Thank you all for being patient! The new bot we're making () seems to be going smoothly, and we re-organized the server so it is more intuitive. I'd like to open this weekend, but we don't want to rush things.  Sincerely - The Captain First off, you're not my mom. Secondly, you're right. 😅  Third, sorry mom. I think I heard something about that on the BBC. Sounds like a mess. *(I am so close to finishing it.)* I need to focus. AHH!? Now you guys are making me want to play on the server instead of making videos. :D Also, fun fact, someone made an underwater canal that extends the Nile really deep into the jungle. It's helpful for travel. But you make a good point! I do like the idea of messing with the world. Maybe Damming it isn't that crazy. ^ Infinite water https://tenor.com/view/minecraft-minecraft-axolotl-farm-minecraft-water-minecraft-loop-gif-24110649 Why are you guys obsessed with terraforming water ways. 😂 Yeah, Africa is definitely the least populated continent. But the map isn't as big as you'd expect, so the nations in Africa are actually somewhat close. 2/2 1/2 I'm a little weird. I enjoy storage organizing since it feels satisfying to have everything in its right place. Maybe I will be a desert dweller. To be honest, I didn't plan on doing much in Svalbard. I prefer to be a nomad, but I need a place to store stuff. Yup! It is owned by a medium sized YouTuber (Ro11en) who makes update videos about the history of the server. (For reference) No one else was living there, so it's perfect for me to store stuff. Svalbard. It's very hectic. There are always people there. Also, this is what Europe looks like on the server which is cool. Oof! Of all the Fallouts to play. 😅  Do you still enjoy it? (Maybe that is why I play Fallout 🤔 ) Yah, the server is fun for a while, but I want to explore people's bases and since everything is claimed it's really hard. I love exploring abandoned ruins and lost towns. Not sure if I will keep playing on the server though. I made a small home in Svalbard to store stuff at. It's out of the way which is nice. Atlantis. Some people are making an underwater base of sorts. I joined a Minecraft Earth Factions server and found a giant wooden structure in the Atlantic. It read "Rose Fort", so I fixed it. I just joined a random minecraft server and was killed by someone named FuzzyDino.  Then, after killing me a few times they asked if I was "The Real Bread Pirate" 😂 Discord allows you to type it, even if it doesn't work. Yah, it's disabled. Wait, that works?  I hope you aren't able to do that. 😅 That would be a mistake on my part. It looks fantastic. I need to play Red Dead 2. Personally, I believe the city battle segments went too long. But the coast line episodes were TOO SHORT. I loved exploring abandoned houses and searching for loot. I could play an open world game like that for hours. They gained weight. Answered it in DM's. 😄 Done. Alright, nice fake out. So I am surviving. The work has been easy, and it's been awesome meeting people. But as it goes on it is bound to get busier. Ahoy Dune!  To add to what Yoshi said... Don't use all caps excessively. It's annoying.  Wii U players united! https://docs.google.com/document/d/15-uB8X1wzngp3cQcz1DSRQ-aNoQa031x-81T23lWxYg/edit#bookmark=id.yhzgs7et72y It'll explain things way better than I could via discord. Oh! Let me send a link to my FAQ. I have a section for that.  There is a game named that! I played it once. Gaming Hype And it is our nut. <:Nuts:723608947830816778> I know fellow Zelda Youtubers who do it well. It takes a little work, but it can be worth it. It's a fun idea, but would need some alterations to work. For instance, it would be fun to have a challenge for members to race to find a picture in the game. (Ex. I take a picture of a tree in Faron and people have to find out which tree it is and take the same picture.) But until I am finished with mid-terms I'm not willing to consider it. Water wins. 🏆 That could work ^? They can't ALL be bad. :| What if they used a safer website? Why didn't you start with that! That's serious stuff. Really?  Problem Solved! Veto.  I think these quizes are really funny. As long as it doesn't go on for DAYS, it's fine. Oh no.... I think I'm going to lose. And it's a pretty small laptop. 😅 My laptop weight more than your sword. It's everything I wanted and more. 🥲 No, no, NO! They are spreading!!! I have a few coin collections so I can 100% confirm this. Yah, it's a celebratory state quarter so it's from after the 90's.  1890 must be when the state was founded. Dog 1: The Human has seen to much. Dog 2: What is our course of action? Dog 1: Activate Protocol: Too Cute to be Evil. They'll forget everything they just saw. That is delicious. https://tenor.com/view/surprised-pikachu-pokemon-shock-surprised-pikachu-gif-15357817 And on the main channel. Nah, I already did a ton of reveals on my Live Action channel. (And hiding my hands so she doesn't try eating them.) This is Yoshi sleeping on me. Cat pics incoming... Thanks for the tip! I switched it from 2 weeks to 1 week and missed the s Whoops. 😄 Bad Chu Chu! Nice tennis ball alter. E! It does not like floors. Since we usually put pet images here, I'll add my cat to the mix. Ha ha! Nice pun. :D  Ayy, that's super cool! He told me he wanted to do that. It's cool to see it happened. I thought it was a chest. Mind blown. Thanks clover! I enjoy my college work, so it's not a drag for me! I just wish I could do Youtube at the same time. Yah, it is stinky, but I can't do much about it. __Just this week__ -5 page paper -Writing an article for college newspaper -making a video for college film festival -normal homework It's a shame I won't be able to capitalize on this success. College killed this week. Plus, my next video is a BIG project, so that'll take serious time to finish. A little of both I suppose. I deleted it because it was a pigeon. Not for that reason. Viola! Pigeons have been deleted from the universe. 😁 I have a plan! I use mercy... And then fake out the pigeon with a Guardian laser to the face! Ooo, cute cat pictures! I'm getting snow tonight. Weird. Hey Preston! I noticed you sent a friend request.  I don't accept them from people I don't know, but if you're looking to talk my DM's are always open. Oh, hello, old sport! Might you be a fan of the Great Gatsby?  Welcome aboard! Welcome aboard! Welcome aboard! I like those odds. Ayy! Perfect timing. What are the odds. I just rewatched that movie last month. It was just as incredible as the first time I watched it.  Apologies, but your username was the perfect opportunity for a Back to the Future reference. https://tenor.com/view/hello-mcfly-gif-11271548  Welcome aboard! Not sure if that's who it is. 🤔  Sounds ominous. But right now I'm working on a Zelda History video. Something featuring a certain large theorist. But of course! Who wouldn't want to. 😁  Welcome aboard! I didn't expect to see you here. 😀  I love your editing style! It's inspiring that you do all that with Davinci Resolve. The only difference is that I have college bogging me down. Anyone can be a Youtuber. 😋  Welcome aboard then! It's nice to meet you. 😁 <:cool:929182035359199283> We have a notepad? Why did I forget this. - Boost server role - Video uploads @ here - minimum time on server before sending images in general There isn't much to suggest he had childhood trauma in Majoras Mask. However, we only see his father and his mother in absent. So maybe that effected him? Get roasted. You are a brave man. **Are you afraid of Tingle?** ✅ Yes ❌ No Au Nah, it's alright if it's a little chaotic. I'll delete this channel in a few days. I guess it's for polls. https://tenor.com/view/go-on-im-listening-listening-keep-talking-eating-gif-4920341 It does look really epic. Dear lord, not this again. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  Hacks. 😄 That's a good point! These were a blast to explore and were completely optional. ^ I miss the pitch black caves of Twilight Princess and the hidden grottoes of Ocarina of Time. Dungeons in conjunction with mini-dungeons, grottoes, caves, and monster camps would be amazing. That would be scary if it had a SAD code. It'd be interested in hearing what you discover. Even Wikipedia itself disagrees on the date. Sometimes it will directly say "August 22nd" This is most confusing. Yes. It turns out that Hyrule Encyclopedia gives a date of August 22, while most online sources say July 1. But maybe its date it wrong! Where did you hear it was in July?  According to Zelda Wiki, the NES Legend of Zelda released in August.  I love that reference. 😄 Oh. Sorry about that. The anniversary for Zelda is February 21. Skyward Sword HD is coming out in July.  I'm still confused. 🤔  I am highly intrigued about your theory from yesterday. What is your reasoning for NA getting a different anniversary release? Nobody **knows**, although most people assume it will be based on BotW's story since it is called the "Sequel" to the game. I thought it was an interesting theory! Aww... that would be sad. OooO! Maybe he's from Lurilin What? Oh! I see. That sounds like a reasonable reward. We can do that. I am going to need some help here. What does hoisted mean in this context? Ha ha, that's hilarious. There is nothing but pink on the screen. Did Navi just kill this guy?  That'll show you! (Komali Dies)  I'm sorry it had to come to this Komali. I see. Then they deserve death.   How did they cheat? Interesting concept, but I don't think that'd fit my content.  Okay. 😋  I only privated the channel for a night. Then I resurrected it from death!  Pay no heed to the crazy man. 🤣  He thinks one of his videos were deleted, but it's unrelated to the bipolar thing. Yes, but now I have un-snarkied the channel. Misshow? Is that a user? Oh well then. Now I am going to be the snarkiest person by removing this channel! MUH HA HA HA!!!! (Just for one night.) Just DM it to me.  Can you share the video that you wanted to post? And no, he's not being sarcastic. He's just keeping the server organized. Lior is doing his job. That's not being snarky. This is a level of dedication I can never hope to achieve. You have made me proud son. It sounds just like I imagined it would! This dude made a lightshow in his house! ^ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPmCdQyDSGE&lc=UgwEiczEL0jIb-B_Vph4AaABAg.9R7GoNTDeSC9RKXIduHY0N Oh boy, intros are tough to figure out. Good luck with it. That sounds more accurate. 😄 Ha ha, it's be a pretty bland montage. I don't practice combat glitches/techniques. Maybe someday I could make a bulk video where I fulfill all my old promises. Could be funny.  Yah, unfortunately a lot of my plans from that time period fell through. I found a different style of videos I liked better so some ideas are just dead or pending. I'm a bit of a squirrel in that way, always getting distracted by something new. 😅 Nice find! Moreso, you proved something different! On cemu it seems that explosives work different than in game. Yet I love it!  That is wrong is so many ways. I got to get one of those If only I had bread coupons. I love this jam. So relaxing. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLUtrnJZK3Q Because it's fake. 😄 It's a cover of the 80's song "I Need a Hero" Just learned about this Beta Version of Dire Dire Docks. They decided against releasing it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcoXuRjPUcw That was a very long message. 😄 Instead of this being a single bot, I like to pretend this is an army of parrot bots starting up. I see! Thanks for the explination. (I wonder what they're plotting) Must be coder jargon. What do you have against Tik Tok? :O You are a weird anime. AH! It's TINGLE!   That that is fantastic. While we have a lot of "members," we have a pretty small group of "regulars". Can't say I have. I watched an hour of Jojo this semester to find footage of Dio talking (long story for why I needed that). But, I haven't watched a full episode. Technically it's a "top." Speaking of which, I just added a pinned comment explaining the ending! I did! That's a throwback! That is impossible. El Gasp So you're half right! It is almost finished. I just need to do music and a thumbnail now. My thoughts exactly.  Learning this blew my mind. **Today I Learned:** The Crocodile in Peter Pan is symbolic. It has a clock inside it because it represents time. So, when Captain Hook is running from the Crocodile it is because he is afraid of time catching up with him and killing him. So, it works. My mom says "Fart Muffins" when she swears. It's a substitute swear.  Example: "Aw peanut brittle." It's a cussing good show. I love that film. It's so surreal. No way!!! "Sweet Mother of Pearl" "Fart Nuggets" "Peanut Brittle"  "Son of a Pup" "What the Cuss" "Are you cussing with me?" Plus, there are WAY better words to use when you are frustrated. Yah, lots of curse words are just words that mean gross things. But they have a negative connotation in society.  You are right. I am getting distracted. Ha ha! By the way, congrats on finishing Primary Education. Hii!!! Muh ha ha, I have foiled your use of gross words. 😈 Only once? Those are rookie numbers. Here, have another Taco. 🌮  That's okay! If you set your mind to it, I know you'll make great animations. This is just practice. Fly around and say "watch out" Can you animate Navi ? I'm sure there are photos of them in session from the 20's and 30's, right? Can you find pictures of the League at other times? You'd think the League of Nations would have done a better job. In that case, hello! Hey? Recently I learned you can right click clips and render them while in Davinci Resolve. It helps when you have lots of fusion clips. That's a lot of Yo Might be poisoned with iocane powder. Thanks for the offer but I decline. This is the correct version. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzqHkgjEs0 It was. 😂  It was the first search result. Crap, wrong version.  Tetra's Ship Bingo.  Fusion is scary, but I dip my toes into it sometimes. Usually to do motion tracking. Nuts, you beat me Taco.  Davinci Resolve.  I sure hope so! I talked with someone who had over FIFTY layers once. He talked about it like it was an accomplishment, but I was just scared. 😳 I am having problems with YouTube too. Things are laggy. But it can look different if you change the recipe. For instance, they sprinkle a little bit of flour on it at the end (which I forget to do). And I make one BIG loaf instead of two loafs. Essentially it does. I always use this recipe. It's a lot of fun, and has few ingredients.  https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/the-easiest-loaf-of-bread-youll-ever-bake-recipe Oof. I forgot to post a picture of my last loaf. I should do that. Yah. For example, I get called Naive all the time for not understanding innuendos. I would count that as positive. But, if I called Yoshi naive for thinking he could bake a good loaf of bread, that would be negative. It could be negative or positive depending on the context. Naive has a neutral connotation in my mind. And make sure to get "Very Silly Songs".  It was the episode that first featured the pirates who don't do anything. https://tenor.com/view/palpatine-star-wars-emperor-do-it-go-for-it-gif-17446081 I love the Chocolate Bunny Episode, so at least you are holding onto a classic. HA! Mood.  I just read your Discord Profile About Me. 😂 Terranigma Applewood ...and A Hat in Time Don't tempt me. I have enough distractions already. 😂 *or swim Nah... I'd run. I am more of a revolver guy myself. It's very satisfying to use in the game. I also love Black Mesa, the fan remake of the first game. I absolutely love that game. The atmosphere is so... 👌  Oof. Then it's probably not the right game for yah. 😅  You can check my record on the recordboard. I think I'm one of the slowest times in Bugless.  When did you play it? At launch, the game was really empty but it has a lot of updates now. I also have been playing an excessive amount of Sea of Thieves. Very good! I am more than half way done with my latest video, and I still have the whole summer ahead of me. Ping I don't know much about glitches, but it sounds like blss is difficult. Oof x2 Wow... sounds like that save file is ruined. Oof! That's okay. Lots of people get thrown off by that rule.  Happy to help! :D Yeah, we have waterfalls all over the place! I even have a few on my family's property. There's also a NASCAR track, tons of wineries, boating, and several festivals. It is honestly a hidden gem. It's very pretty, but the tourists make the roads busy. The Finger Lakes Region. Thanks! It took me a while to figure out I wanted to be a Zelda Fun facts YouTuber, but I agree that it is a stable niche. I have a good feeling about this video. I agree Dune. Also, feel free to ping me if you want to get my attention!  It's easier for me. I'm also working on a video about 25 Useless facts about BotW. It's just taking a REALLY long time. So I'm doing pretty good right now. I have scurvy, my teeth are falling out, and I lost an arm while working the rigging. Most people still use plastic straws where I live. Oh no.   Hope you stay safe. That's okay.  It is probably better to start with the Abridged copy by William Goldman since he made it more accessible to a modern audience. It's also way easier to find. No, Florin. It's across the channel from Guilder. Have you read the original, unabridged version? It was really hard to find a copy but I got one while I was in Florin. Only one year after Zelda 1 Personally, I use DvD. You have a lot of options! Yah, he did a lot of voice acting, but nothing as famous as UP. Ha ha! I thought they were good too. Oh wait! You said "beginning" My bad. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dug_Days Cough... Um. Who is going to tell him? My top three movies shift all the time. - Up - The Princess Bride (Permanent Resident in my top 3) - It's a Wonderful Life - Indiana Jones 1+3 - The Road to El Dorado - Pirates of the Caribbean 1 You speak the truth. Yes. Every little bit helps! My outro catch phrase is from the Princess Bride for a reason.  is right. It's in my top 3 movies. Coding physics sounds difficult. DANG! Everyone here is doing coding!! Yes! That is where my name comes from. Not as good as the Princess bride tho Impossible! If you live in New York then that means we are in the same state. And that would never happen. Nice, we did that. HI Very cool! There are a lot of web coders here. You know HTML and CSS? Hi swamp! Also, welcome to NY. You have heard correctly about my website. It is a website for my channel. Hand-coded and everything! It's pretty good looking too, but it's not live yet. I need to set up a host etc... In regards to this message.  Thanks for letting me know!  It's a shame they deleted their message. Whoever it was. It's a tricky book to talk about in a church setting. It is depressing and somewhat Nihilistic (meaning it says like is meaningless and there is no reason to live). But, at the end it ties the story together by saying, God makes life worth living. I believe that makes it the most unique book of the Bible. I'm late to the conversation, but I enjoy Ecclesiastes too!  It's my favorite book of the Old Testament. (James is my favorite in the New Testament)  I like the verse that says, "The living know one thing: they will die. The dead know nothing." It's deep. We should protest to get April back! Now you're speaking my language, contrarion! You might want to be healthy, but I embrace my newfound sickness. 🤧 🤤 Everybody keeps saying that, but nobody asks if that's what I want! Maybe I want to feel like a slug all day. Has that NOT occurred to anyone?!  You're not my Mom! You can't tell me what to do. <:mad:730068988301803530>  (But seriously, thanks!)  I'm a bit sick right now but I'm excited for the summer. How are you? Ahoy Yoshi! _Accidentally got the bad guy's theme from Indiana Jones: The Last Crusades stuck in his head._ That too! Especially when said people exist overseas in Britain, etc. It makes scheduling annoying. That is a relief. Timezones are the bane of my existance when collaborating for YouTube videos. Basically the same thing. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa4m_6Rtmes  I agree! The synth instrument sounds like the horn instrument in the Ordon Village Ranch theme. It represents the inner most desires of our generation.  It is art A boar that has style! I never liked Zant. He's too alien looking for my liking. 👽 I prefer Ganon since he feels like a Medieval fantasy villain. I'm sure it feels lame after 6 years. But that's because it's a game about exploration and we found almost everything.  I agree! I'm not sure how much you know of the story, but Jesus specifically waited until the Jewish Passover in order to complete his ministry. So it's very intentional. I side with Yoshi on this one. Ha ha, that was a good one. I've never bought a Minecraft Lego set, but my favorite Lego Sets growing up were the ones with tons of droids or storm troopers in them.  It was fun to set up armies with them. Yes! Exactly. Depends on how you define "boring" and "exciting". For me, reading about history and playing video games is exciting. But for my sister is would be like living in heck. But I think it shows that the risk of Cancer is a real thing, and that's all  was trying to show.  The website actually acknowledges your point about risk being effected by lifestyle.  ```Your risk may be higher or lower than these numbers, depending on your particular risk factors.``` I read the BBC instead of American news because it isn't tainted by Republican or Democratic bias. It makes it easier to trust what they say. However, when the BBC talks about British politics, then I believe there is more bias. https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-basics/lifetime-probability-of-developing-or-dying-from-cancer.html I wouldn't be so sure. Cancer is fairly common. Cancer.org claims there's a 40.14% risk of developing cancer in males in the US. I have it happen all the time.  We believe you! It's easy to bump into fake info online.  How could you tell it was fake so quickly? I didn't even have a chance to see it. 😂 Holy, wow. That was fast.  I second this! It's important to give people credit, and to make it clear where information comes from. Historians, YouTubers, Marketing Analysts, and many other types of people have to do it.  Zelda II is ironically funny. It did not intend to be funny. Discord is haunted. The sword that shoots bread! Nonsense Lior! Nayru cannot be a friend. He is a menace! Just look at his beady subrosian eyes. He's planning something, I just know it. Then it was literally HOT 🌶️ What! How can dark chocolate hot chocolate taste bad? I love dark chocolate so this makes me sad. I don't want to know. Meanwhile, I just had the WORST hot chocolate ever. It tasted rancid. All the foreign food chains are out to kill you.  😂 Interesting! Not the answer I expected, but a welcome one to be sure.  Ayy! Long time no see. Thanks for the help Arch. Thank you too Ghost!  Thanks Goat! 😍  You are thee goat. https://forms.gle/eizB1amLbho9irVM9 Should take 3 minutes. Anyone willing to help me with a Home Work assignment? I need to test if a survey works. I prefer The Spanish Inquisition, but I don't expect anyone will have heard of it.  I like that, good lunch works! Good noon? Not sure what to say at a time like this. 😂 I've never heard of that before. That's fishy. I would add that a good character can be someone you despise.  The fact people talk about Revali's personality so much (and sometimes how much they hate him) makes him a good character because that was his purpose. To be a rival to Link and someone we butt heads with.  Nice People =/= Good Story Writing. And yes, please don't insult the mods. They volunteer to do this, they want to keep the server family friendly, and they aren't trying to make people miserable. The "hades" is fine. We even have a rule about letting substitute words being allowed. Yup. Just sometimes. College gets in the way a lot. Darn. If I can't use a gun sword then I will use a sword-gun. How about a gun sword? I don't remember the old title either. 😄  Thanks for letting me know about that typo! I changed the video title recently and made that mistake. 😅 One day soon.  Aw that stinks. Snow can be a great thing (when it doesn't cut your power and make things super cold).  I'm sure you'll get to see snow someday! You just need an excuse to be in the north. 😋 🌨️ I always have visual snow outside my window in upstate new york. Godspeed. And make sure to send it to me afterward. It'll be fun to see what you make. Ayy! That's a great idea. I had a lot of fun making my FAQ so you probably will too. I don't have any tips about professionalism, but I suggest you use a table of contents like I did. Then, watch this video (0:41) and learn how to add links to parts of the FAQ. That will make it easier for people to find stuff. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkmbXRfp-8A I declare math illegal! Last I checked, math isn't a bread ingredient. Yah, Dark Green and Maroon are my favorites. You must be psychic.  No worries! I enjoy being pinged from time to time. It's called "Catch Fish" and was from Twilight Princess. If there are any other themes from my videos you need, check the description. I always give credit to the songs used. Yah! I'll paste a link to my live action channel here... https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ2gvOTa8i0oFPQjPVQ0oAg Coming out from a box was the greatest smash reveal of all time. Okay, that feels wrong. Stop messing with my head. 😂 A 1700's sloop. Very much so Spiderman Homecoming. Hadn't seen it yet. Sorry for ditching the conversation! I was watching a movie with family. That's an interesting way of doing school. My parents WERE my motivation at first. I respected them enough to try harder at school to make the proud. Then, I started enjoying school because I loved learning. I think it helped that I went to a small school with teachers that were invested in the students. Big Awesome. And good will towards men. ☮️ *Runs away.* I am going to steal bread now. Thanks to all who freed me from the brig!! By the way! You're free now. Godspeed! And thank you for helping free me!

Since you have killed the parrot, I am forced to concede defeat. Alright, is that it? Grrr.... alright. GASP!! Without my parrot I am defenseless!  Alright, what are your terms? He was the last obstacle in my way. Ah... glad to be done with that filthy mod, Lior. Never!! Nothing can stop me now! I am all powerful!! Good, clover has been banned. Then you are a heretic! Bleh, saltines are disgusting. Of course I will vote for myself! How else will I be president. Is this a vote to make me president? AH! Where?! Impossible! And I'll ban ALL of you if I have to! Of course not! He said heresy! What! Lior? There's no way I am Lior... er... I mean, of course the other Bread Pirate is Lior! This is nonsense! Why don't I just ban everyone and make sure this imposter is dead once and for all. What? My quest is to destroy this imposter! My name is The Bread Pirate But not me, of course. I saw The Bread Pirate vent! I would never lie! Would a fake bread pirate need a bot to talk? Please, of course I am real! Hm... Slurp sounds like a heretic. hehe What! I would never do such a thing... 🙄 What purge? Especially for being your first run. Impressive! Ha ha, thanks! Most of them at least. I think he's joining in on the typo-ing. 😄 Exactly! It's a gud thing I can't speell. Here! I'll send a link to my FAQ page about it: https://docs.google.com/document/d/15-uB8X1wzngp3cQcz1DSRQ-aNoQa031x-81T23lWxYg/edit#bookmark=id.kiwt31opyo2v Pirates only need carpenters who can help make peglegs. Lies!! That last part surprised me! Do the enemies drop the food mid way through eating it? Sun Tzu said that! ^ Doctors...? Who needs those.  This man knows where it is at! Yup. The only real way to get the vaccine is with a lance.  Hi Turtle! I don't own any amiibo because they are super expensive. But I like the way the way the Ganondorf Amiibo looks. It helps generate conversation. It's fine if he wants to ping me on the server. Righteous. Oh yah! Well you're wack too. 🤣 I agree! There last video was amazing. Fun Fact: The Swamp Pirate just watched Oversimplified this week. Bad maps? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ The land payed for itself a thousand fold. At 4¢ an acre, it's basically free. Thanks for the free land Napoleon! <:happy:725779401031024641> I have a coin from 1812 with Napoleon's face on it. I think he was a fascinating figure. Now that is impressive. (I'm a New Yorker) I'll make sure to stay away. California is wack. What kind of highschool is this? She doesn't understand how hard a sub-five minute mile is, that's the problem. This is communism! As if males need oxygen less than females. That's ludicrous Excuse me...? Why is he setting the bar so high for the males in the class, but is giving the females a reasonable time. Does he expect the females in the class to run that fast too? Cause I know female college runners that struggle to get that time. He what!? 5 minute miles are crazy hard to get. We people physically can't even go that fast. I should know this since I got a 4:58 mile ONCE in high school track. That should show how hard it is. I can see why you slowed on the last lap. Holy smokes! 5:30 is incredible!  Ahhhh! I'm sorry to hear about that. Hope your leg gets better... Otherwise we're giving you a peg leg. But thanks for the offer. Maybe later this month. Sorry Goat! I got finals to worry about currently, so not at the moment. Maybe I should reconsider making yee all walk the plank. Aww, Thank you!     Careful! You might be spoiling an idea for a future video. 🤫 😋 I have been lied to this whole time! It's just flour, water, and yeast.  You can eat bread and be vegan. Hello Sephiroth! Mega pog Makes snow angel in bread.  I'll eat some bread with you! *Dies* Oh... this kind of pain is different. I'm hit. AHHH 🩸 *Bullet switches directions and hits Bread* *Shoots Midna again for fun* You should use that, but make sure to use the lowest setting. otherwise you'll burn the bread. By the way, there's a toaster in the back of the room. It tastes better with butter, trust me. *Casually hands Swamp butter and plate.* Alright, so I brought butter. You guys want to share the bread without Midna? *Shoots Midna again* When you open the door you see a mostly empty room with a pedestal in the middle. Golden light shines down on the pedestal... there lies the Holy Bread of Zimbabwe.  That's okay. I'm a pirate. 😄 The key is stale. You don't want to eat that (The key is made of bread) (Hands key over) Here! You mean this key? https://tenor.com/view/indiana-jones-sword-gun-harrison-ford-gif-3495425 Oh... um.  I don't know what you mean by challenging my Stash. 😋 The second season wasn't quite as good, but overall I love the series. One Punch Man is basically a great anime. Oooo, good idea. Exclamation points fix everything! School Shootings are scary, but rare. You shouldn't let them worry you. Just do what you can to make the world a brighter place. It might not seem like much, but it goes a long ways. Make sure to check out his website. It's really cool. You mean  We did? Ha ha, I considered calling it "Ask Bread" when I first made it. But I was worried that'd be confusing.  OH! That makes way more sense. 😂  I have always wanted to make a channel about *Terranigma*, the underrated SNES game from the 90's. I also considered making a Hat in Time channel, but decided against it; Not enough motivation. Noice A small Zelda inspired game where you explore a few dungeon rooms and kill a dragon. Super small and simple. The Game Watch was a literal watch you wore. You mean Game and Watch. The 1980's Nelsonic Zelda Gamewatch Yes Have fun! I'd love to see that happen. If you have a small thing you need to tell me I'm open! I have no idea anymore. 😂  The reason I added that was to prevent people from randomly messaging me everyday. I don't have time to answer messages that often. With 21 candle's on it. Bread.  Ayy, thanks for the Birthday wishes! [Goes into box and is sad] But I'm at college. I don't have the mug. That is unfortunate. Good thing we don't have threads. Huh, I wonder where I have seen that mug before... 😏 Using gifs in the context of a conversation is fine. I do it all the time. It's nice to meet you!  For a second I thought I already met you. Then I realized you're a SECOND mango pirate! 😂 Should be good now Oh, I see. All commands are already disabled. I'll look into it. What is the problem with them? They don't do anything. ~~Bucky~~ Thanks for the scoop ~~Riptide~~ Lior! Oh dang! I knew the video was doing well, but not that well. No, you do.  That means he's doing a good job. But for now, I go to sleep.  Sounds interesting. I'll need to look into it some time. Sweden is no where near Malta.  Pretzels. Oh, Malta? Well it has a great geographic location due to it's centrality in the Mediterranean and it's proximity to Italy. I think it has a good chance to climb the world stage so long as it takes advantage of it's coasts. I was going to go to bed. I don't think he's trolling, but I'm also really tired right now.  Huh... nice. So what is it you wanted? Well, I didn't think you'd still be awake. You texted me hours ago. Right click my name. Click message.  Dm means "Direct Message" Wheat bread. It makes me feel healthier. Yes. No idea why you pinged, but that's okay! 😋  Just DM me when you get back on line if you needed anything. Arg!  Wrong chat for memes. One or two is fine, but don't flood general with them. E, thanks. 😄 I like playing military songs on it during Memorial Day events. I have a trumpet! I used to do it in High School. Rick would be proud. Please do! That is genius!! Ha ha, I think most college students can relate. So far so good! I'm a bit overwhelmed, but surviving. That's a weird gif. ^ It's the thought that counts. I've played the Half Life games and can confirm it is "Goron Freeman"  Thanks Maka! Ha ha, thanks Riptide! I would never miss a period Thanks! Probably the ladybug one or the Final Math Essay. 😄 Not that money matters a lot for collabs. Most of them are done for fun.  When Zelda Youtubers collaborate, each Youtuber keeps the ad revenue from their specific video. It makes things easier. Oh! That's good. I thought you were confused by what Riptide was talking about.  Do you know about my live-action videos? That's from my Live-Action channel... https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ2gvOTa8i0oFPQjPVQ0oAg Oh no! Well, if you need help with it I'm always available. Heck yah! That is still one of my favorite videos. 😂  I use Paint Net to edit thumbnails. It's similar to photoshop, but it is free. Thanks Ron! 😄 Thanks Gab! Ah! That makes sense. You must be a fast worker then. 😅  Oof! Well good luck with Stem.  Here it is ^ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU6xfLBsTKY  That's an awesome question! I think my 100 sub video was the most fun to make. It was silly, easy to edit, and clever. I can get a link to it... Didn't see much purpose for it. Yah, we got rid of it. ^ and take screenshots if there is a real problem. (jk) I haven't played it yet, so you're fresh out of luck here. Yes, I would like some advice. Do you have some? Weird. ^ I just released a BotW video yesterday! Still doing BotW.  Hello Gabileotank! (Maybe) 😄 Yah, but it was a lot less professional. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z3J5BsfOvQ&list=PLmWFiszEHip7wczcGgD0yarwMDIktbrnh Tried that once. Didn't go well. 😄 No worries! Duh Just bring an Ice Type pokemon with you. If it were a brown sheath I'd use it. The sheath on the gerudo equipment doesn't match my outfit well. 😦 The Role-Player. That's why I used my outfit for that segment. Nice! Sike! [Confused Pirate Noises] *Wait a minute.* Me too... Oh no... this meme. 😂 Normal Text Overlays won't work. It can only be done with Text+ Give me a second, I can send a screen shot.  Davinci Resolve has an option for "text Scrawl" (I think that's what it's called). The arrow is part of  pre-made video. Here is an example...  No, it means he did all the divine beasts.  Ron is right. The "What Your Favorite Zelda Game Says About You" video started the spike in views. Not gonna rush it though.  Hopefully.  I had to put my editing on hold due to vacation, but I'm back now. That is an interesting observation! Not sure how I'd make it into a video, but I'll consider it.  What video was that? That was a wacky looking flip. Ahoy HB! Ha ha, at least I appreciated the sentiment. 😄 That is fantastic! 😂 Yes! Normally I'd discourage this kind of spam... but this Link tower is super funny. 🤣 It's nice looking, but doesn't fit the emoji selection we're going for.  We try to add 8-Bit emojis whenever possible, even if it means we need to make them by hand. (Although we had some exception when we first made the server) Thanks Tea! I'll post more in  Yoshi the Cat ^ Sure! Give me a second.  My cat chews my wires sometimes.  Oof. Not bad, it's just too early to tell how the day is going. Middle of the road. I have both versions. Normally I play Java.  Maybe!  Let's Plays don't get a lot of views but take me a lot of time to edit (at least the way I do them take forever).  I also have the attention span of a squirrel so it's hard for me to finish lets plays.  Oof! I sure hope I don't quit Youtube. I love it as a hobby. 😄 Some people presume it was suppose to be the powered-down version of the Master Sword, which would mean it would have infinite durability. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I didn't get a chance to test the sword myself, so I don't know. The modders who found it didn't document the durability. Yes! Shoot!  I was considering making a *Top ~10 Facts About Rain* video this week, but I had a better idea. It might take me a while to make though. Aw... thank you guys. 🥰  That would be glorious. Just recording footage (which is boring) but necessary. A-Okay! What eye patch... 🙄 ❤️ I wanted to stay on to see how many people were reading it. Yah, the cursor shows up whenever I am on the document. The only way to make it disappear is if I leave. Heck yah we do.  Someone didn't read the FAQ.  I like the second one! It looks like the clouds are wrapping around the sun.  Nah, if we wanted to be mean we'd use ancient arrows. 😄  I forgot that you can use bombs on them! Do bomb arrows work? Yes I did! I was a counselor. I helped the kids get to activities and made sure they didn't kill eachother in their sleep. 😂  Camp was exhausting but fun! Wow... way to hurt Peater's feelings. He's trying his best. Yup! It's from the Xenoblade cross over. It made sense to me. Hey! That's literally me! 😄 Odyssey was good, but it's been a few years since that released.  I just gave you the member role. Somehow you've gone without it for months. 😄  That is speed. OH MY GOSH! How did I miss that. 🤣 If he's watching my older videos that would explain it.  I use a Blue Snowball Ice. I've had it for 4 years now, and I have no idea what Dread is talking about with "grainy" sound. No worries. If I accepted every friend request I got I'd have 500 friends on my list or something. 😂 Yah, sorry about that Cheesy. Or if I work with them for videos. Oh, sorry. I don't usually accept friend requests unless I know the person really well.  Deleted for including a swear word. This is a FAMILY FRIENDLY server. Ahoy! But don't advocate it unless it's the only reasonable way of playing a game.  It's alright to mention emulation.  Yes. Now the Earthbenders can replicate Majoras Mask.  You basically NEED to emulate the game to play it if you live in North America since it wasn't release there. If you live in Europe, Australia, or Japan then it's possible to play normally, but it's not going to be cheap. I wouldn't blame yah for emulating it. It is AMAZING! The story was so compelling and nearly made me cry.  That would make sense! Terranigma is a popular SNES game in Europe. Because it wasn't profitable. Most of their games flunked in America  There is a really simple and dumb reason... The American Localization branch at Enix (the developers of the game) was closed months before the game was finished. We have like... idunno, twelve or so people on this discord. I can't be the only person. Well that doesn't help. 😂 Darn.  Is that a no? Has anyone here played Terranigma? I interact with my fan every night when I turn it on And mud. Muck is mud but yucky. Hioy *Mostly alive Just slightly dead. 😋 Or is your standard of death just really really low. Is it really dead? Yah, don't put your server drama on this server. Why would you be creepy? Skyrim is good! Have fun. Well, the Oled model uses normal Joycons, so don't get too cocky about it. Wait! My bad, that French one was part of a non profit organization. I'm confusing that with the investigation that was started by the EU. France literally has a department suing Nintendo over it. Yah, and there are several lawsuits in the works about it. Some by average people, and a few by countries. New joycons is a must. The fact that Nintendo refuses to fix it is atrocious. I'd like to see a console like that, even if it wasn't 100% backwards compatible. That is reasonable.  Oh, if you're just talking about the Oled model then I agree, but I mean if there were a REAL upgraded Switch.  But if there were a new console then it'd obsolete all your old games. Having an updated Switch gives people the best of both worlds.  That is a fine name for a horse. Wow! That sounds disgusting. Hope you have fun with it. 😋 What will it be about? Ay! Good luck.  That's a lot. 😮 (Just need to get off my lazy bum and make a script) A-Okay! We could try. But I'll leave Mee6 until the parrot is ready. You could say that again. I'm sorry Burger. No you're not.  Yes it has. Right! I'll have to remember that. I see you've stuck with that Anime character as your avatar. What was their name again? Feels like forever since I've seen yah Tax. 😅 Ahoy! The Blue ICE Snowball is a type of mic. They're talking about mics Durian. *(A Whole New World)*  Probably not. There are a ton of recipes.  Glad I could teach something new to yah! Ahoy Cant! Indeed! Yah. Whenever it's your own channel, server, etc...  That type of content normally goes in the  channel.  Someone get this man a medal.  That doesn't sound very *in character* for Bark. 😅 Bark is a bit like Vizzini from The Princess Bride. Good luck getting a compliment out of him. I had accidentally left a half finished text message on this channel and changed my mind on finishing it. Oh Actually, if you want to get in contact with me, please do Ping me. Otherwise I'll probably miss it. 😅 Oof! Maybe... but I don't want to think about doing large projects right now.  Whew! If I were to cover all the memorable songs in the Zelda series the video would easily be an hour long.  I learn new stuff just by making them!  Ayy, that's cool you knew it already! You're a BotW veteran.  My username originated from a Misspelling of the name "The Dread Pirate Roberts" which is a character in The Princess Bride. It's the same movie that inspired my outro. 😁 Technically speaking, Tem is right. The Bread Pirate Channel DOES have 10k Subs. It also has 1 sub... and 2 subs... and 29k subs. (Also it's switched backwards since Youtube hasn't updated the ranking. The Sheikah Slate video only recently got that big.) I hope that enlightened you.  You're going to need to sit down to hear this. Those little numbers are called *views*. Each time someone watches a video for 30 seconds or longer the total number goes up by one.  That means 288,000 People watched that top video for 30 seconds or longer. Ayy, nice! You make a good point Hephaestus Hi Tomoya That was for members that joined in the first week of the server. Oh yah, the trusted member role doesnt have a system in place. We just gave the role out when the server was small as a way of indicating who were the "regulars". Probably should have another round of approvals. Yes?  Dm me and I can send the goods! I love the original Link! Great work on that drawing. Thanks for answering that yoshi. My internet went out for a minute and I couldn't respond New plank! Nonsense. We should replace it with a cannon to shoot these mutineers. Much nicer!  E! Thanks!   Crud muffins! Thanks for letting me know. Now I want a magic ring. 😄 That looks great! DM me to let me know exactly what you're looking for. I can get one The text box? That's fantastic!  XD The arrow is included in each video I have three different animated videos with green backgrounds. When I need a text box I slap it ontop of the video and add text afterwards. Lior is too good at video games. Ayy, thanks Hephaestus Maybe even four tomorrow (although it would have to be a short video)  Yes. Three in the last three days. The Legend of Zelda: Caves and Cliffs Edition  Thanks for the congrats! Why have you posted poop on my discord. 😂 Ayy, your welcome. *(You don't know that...)*  Now we're asking the real questions! Better question, who are the clouds? Your welcome. 🥰 Yes. A super big rock.  Ayy! Glad you enjoyed it. Yes. I need this. Nonsense! They could give us a glimpse into the Zelda content for this year and make a new direct for it this fall. Thankfully we found it.  darn it! I'm sure Nintendo could squeeze out 10 minutes to talk about Zelda It's the 35th anniversary so it'd be weird for them not to bring up Zelda games Can't wait for E3 Yello  Good luck! Thanks! I hope I can get 3 videos done before Nintendo's presentation at E3. It's going to be a challenge. I had to spend last night planning my video schedule around it. Wowsers! E3 is coming up fast. I didn't realize it was such a cluster until I did research for the video! I was pretty surprised. Now it makes sense! Thanks Mimick. I'm with what Lior said. 😄 Not a ban. They just ducked out. Huh, what a weird fellow. Gluten Tag Oof That's a good thing! I use it a lot during adventures in Sea of Thieves. I like how it isn't super flashy. The Grand Admiral Hull is fantastic. Great job! You're in safe hands! 😁 You won't get banned. It does't have the ability to do that. It's fixed now. How many emotes did you use? Tingle should be a Zelda villain in BotW2. 😄 So far so good! I've been hammering away at a tricky video. Aye! Just in the nick of time! It was a very big hole. Godspeed! Shotcut can do many things, but don't overwhelm it with INSANE projects. You got this. 😁 I use Davinci Resolve, but you're going to need a few tutorials and about a week of practice to get adjusted. Also, you'll need at least 16 GB of Ram. Adobe Premiere is similar, however Davinci is free. I suggest trying other free softwares before upgrading to Davinci. For example, I used Shotcut for a while.  Have you made videos before? Blue Chuchu is the best mod. Well, that is if there are going to be a lot of pointy sticks. And keep it in Images. I guess you can. Just don't stab people with them. It got dented while we were parking. Well good luck. And don't rush it.  Yes, my PC runs well. 😅 Here's a link to what I have. ^ https://pcpartpicker.com/user/TheBreadPirate/saved/JnPQVn A custom build.  Hi Pokemon!  Strange choice for a font, but it kind of works.  What font it that? Looks like a variation of Sans. Not in Ocariner o' Time! Only void. Not sure how we'll sail to those places though. That's land locked near Kakariko. Oh, umm. Yes? We are sailing towards water. Water Whoop Whoop! Thanks Mimick! Pffft. Empty threats.  I'm not worried about Lior. I hid the keys to the ship so no one can sail it without me. Thank you. 🥰 Best of luck with your classes lonley!  Sounds rough, but it'd be fun to see other Zeltubers in a quiz show.  I'm glad you liked them! Thanks Ferd! Pfftt... it's hard to overwork yourself when you have fun making them. Yes Sure! But it'll need to be quick. 😄 Zelda History and Trivia. For example, "The Zelda Game You Could Only Play Once a Week" & "Top 5 Weirdest Zelda Anniversary Events" Anytime! Sure! I'll be in VC 1 Sounds interesting! What is it?  Thanks for the feedback! 😁 That announcement was too much for Arina to handle. Ayy, thank YOU for watching our videos. It's nice to know people love our work. Bob has been deleted since he was in the wrong server. Thanks Green! I don't think Historians have an exact date, but it's a few thousand years BC If I remember correctly, it started in the middle east with a form of flat bread similar to the tortilla. You mean in history? Wha? Good times. https://tenor.com/view/michael-scott-happy-cry-happy-tears-the-office-gif-7425816 oof I'm not active here. But that's because I was a college student.  Yes you were.  E! I'm glad you liked it! My word. 😂  That's awesome.  Thanks! That helps a lot.  Does this thumbnail work better?  Yes you can be a pirate. 😁  You are a dragon. You can't be burnt. No. 😄 Spread what? If people are going to think that when they see the thumbnail then I might have to change it. Really? But that's not the full answer. E! Thanks guys! This summer I'll be active again. On rare occassions. 😄  I hope it serves you well! Once my semester finishes I will be watching this... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDpR2xluwvI&list=WL&index=42&t=2s It has bread in it, so it must be good. 😄  Your editing is going to be godlike when yah learn fusion. Will you have time this summer to learn it?  You son of a gun! You've been doing your crazy edits without the fusion tab. How did you do that Rock edit?  I'm almost done too! It's so exciting to be so close to the finish. 😄 ^ Yum Yay! We'll have to wait and see how it pans out. I expect this to be a busy summer. 😁 I haven't played in months, so I would be rusty.  But maybe this summer we can! https://tenor.com/view/movies-robin-hood-men-in-tights-robin-hood-quotes-script-gif-14851683 Hulls are stinkin expensive. 😅  That sounds awesome! Have fun earning it. Which one? Plundering, hunting, and collecting treasure. I've never finished a Tall Tale. I only did multiplayer stuff. Yes. Funny you say that, I got Pirate Legend already. Ayy, thanks boss!  I'll try to remember! That's a fun status message. 😁 Video Game videos are especially fun and impractical.  ~~I also think college is a form of school. In fact, I think Youtube can be a type of school that can teach you anything you want. For instance, it can be a school for video editing, modding, history, english, or politics. You name it.~~ Must... hide... 😄 I've been hiding on Invis mode to discourage people from DMing me until I finish finals in two weeks. It's nice to see you too! I can't wait for this semester of college to end. It'll give me more time to talk on the server. Message deleted. That is correct. Swearing is a no-no on this ship. YAY! I think it's fixed? 😖  Neat channel! That would explain it Wait... that still doesn't make sense. How did your cat help you taste wet dog? 😂 Only mostly dead. Which is slightly alive. 😋 I do too.  Re-doing older videos would be fun. However, BotW2 news is coming this year so it's too late to start up a series on the last game. Maybe we can use your idea after BOTW2, but apply it to the sequel. (Example: Fixing Rain In BoTW2) It must be done I'll have to delete my channel now. We can't let Nayru see the video. This is why we can't trust subrosians. Crap is fine. It's just a word for poo. Crap, of course he slipped through the cannon port. Why wasn't Larry at his guard post!  Bloody Nora! How did you get here! 😮 That is gonna be fancy! O_O Nope. Nothing. I got lots of booty and bread. The plundering went amazing! Yes, Many great ones. Both of those options are absolutely cruel! 🤣 And they're so vague! Can I breathe and do nothing? Can I eat? Can I go about life normally? And what does it mean by everything? Do I have to learn all talents, meet all people, and commit every war crime? Seems like a road to destruction. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pequod_(Moby-Dick)#:~:text=Pequod%20is%20a%20fictional%2019th,by%20American%20author%20Herman%20Melville.  The "Pequod" is the name of the ship from Moby Dick. I thought it would be a fun reference. You got that right! I have a lot of college work to do which is slowing down uploads. Sorry boss. 😦 Can I? Yes. Will I? Probably not. Mega rude.  https://tenor.com/view/silence-nobody-cares-wind-gone-gone-with-the-wind-gif-12318325 But I don't play on Hypixel! Only twice a year. 😂 That logic is so messed up. But I'm a Zelda-tuber But I'm not a Minecraft Tuber. 😄 When I plunder Hypixel for it's bread. It was a shock to me. Yes. I died according to Ron.  Darn. I died. *straight to heck Ow. 😖 I getcha. 😋 I didn't get spring break. But on the bright side my summer is going to start weeks before everyone else! Deleted for being inappropriate. Also, wrong channel. Monkey is hip.  It's alright! No sweat. We all have days like that. And yes, no swearing. Don't call people losers, that's mean. You ate wisdom? 😂 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I only change it every week or so. 😅 Nah, don't worry about my status message. It's always like that.  I've heard of him! He's one of the few Zeltubers I haven't met, but I'd like to someday. I am reading a book and am well. The real butt head? Neat. Didn't you know the math teacher? 😂 Ah! Of course. What subject was it? Oof They are nice for recording footage, but aside from that I prefer playing on consoles. I use them. oof Too bad. Oh carp. I missed a history discussion.  Happy BIRTH ANNIVERSARY! We used to have roles. We had a cook, scout, and cannoneer. But it was confusing to implement. Hopefully we can find an easier way to add roles back. How wonderful. 😂  You can still be in the 5K gang. 😋  I think the channel exploded because of the collaboration I did with Zeldom. It gave the channel a kick-start. I don't know what to say.  Later Random! That's nice!  Maybe you can share pics when it's finished. 🥰  By the way, how's your AC island going? Whether people like you or not, I'll be here if you need me. We trust you to act mature. Keep it private.  No need. He's fine. That means he is between 1 and 70 years old. He's good then.  Are you a senior citizen? <:old:812790127364931585>  That sounds like a generalization.  Are you sure the majority of the community is bad? I think the negativity towards Fortnite is unwarranted. The game itself seems fun. I love it so much! Impressive!  Niche is pronounced differently depending on it's context.  Thanks! I put a lot of work into it, so I'm glad you enjoyed it. *guessed it would be E! Thanks. I still don't know who you're thinking about.  There's +60 Zeltubers who do analysis/theories.  Mind blown. 😄 A new vid!? Where? I am alright. 😋 Indeed No. . . 😂  That's an interesting fun fact! Our channel is thicc. Maybe he should. 🤔  Godspeed! Don't get attacked by any Cheeseheads.  Ayy! I'm happy to hear you liked those ideas. :D  Thanks Wolfy! It's a free software called "Paint.Net" If you get it, make sure to get plugins. Otherwise some of the stuff you need will be un-do-able. That might be for the best! Now you can focus better. 😋  I hearby decree you be unconfuzzled! All parts of the sandwich must be included! Much proud. Just don't neglect school work. 😄 BotW is a solid choice! Twilight Princess also used to be my favorite. None. I don't have a favorite. I think they all are great in some way. It's not weird. It's cool that we think the same!  I'm glad to hear you won the battle! When I am out of ideas, I watch other Youtubers for inspiration. That's up to you. Proofs are annoying.  I'm sorry about that. Oh! Ha ha. 😂 The BS Zelda video?  Not for a grade. It was just a film festival for fun. Face reveals on Zelda channel... - BS ZELDA VIDEO - 100 Sub Special - Totally Best Food In BotW Banned. Face Reveal -> <:mad:730068988301803530> Ha ha! Later! https://tenor.com/view/oh-no-top-gear-jeremy-clarkson-no-one-cares-gif-18925814 I was filming myself, with no one around. It was me who took off their mask. And I filmed that in an empty part of the building where nobody lives. I need to get Link's Awakening. Looks like a lot of fun. No. 😄 GO Ginger!  Your supervisor is secretly a ninja. Happy Birth Anniversary!  Double accurate.  Ha ha, thanks. Wow, I need to focus better. I keep getting distracted by reading Zelda Wiki pages. Davinci Resolve I have considered that idea. Someday I might. I only worked with Monster Maze for that video. I've talked with him in the past, but never worked with him. It's a wonderful thing. I agree! It's a masterpiece of BotW film. I didn't do any direct work on the film, but I helped Monster Maze with some mods I made.  Are you sure? Most people think Morshu says "Rubies" in that cutscene. Sorry Hello, I can't give credit! Come back when you're a little, hmm... RICHER! ...As long as you have enough rubies! Zoink! That's mine now. https://tenor.com/view/bernie-sanders-i-am-once-again-asking-for-your-financial-support-gif-16208683 I wish I was... 😖 I'll delete them in a minute to de-clutter the chat.  That's awesome! Mine did too. I made some posters for my college floor (I am a residential assistant)  <:Ginger:795436016801546320>  E! Thanks Cheese! I prefer a classic medieval fantasy adventure. That is why I love Zelda 1, 2, Ocarina of Time, and the Non-Twili Parts of Twilight Princess. That's a good thing! It's better that people appreciate the Sheikah Tech than everyone hating it. I don't like it, but if other people get enjoyment out of it then that can't be a bad thing. Technomancy justifies sci-fi looking elements lore wise. Although it can still clash. E! Thanks Master. Thanks for asking! The Master Sword is, at its core, a piece of metal with a magic woman inside. The sound it makes when FI talks sounds metalic, kind of like a robot, but I don't think of it as Sci-Fi. Regarding that video, I've been struggling to decide if I feel the same way anymore. Perhaps my issue is with clashing-aesthetic, not directly with Sci-Fi. I have to leave for a class, but if you'd like to talk more about communism and history around it I'd be up for it! Standing up to a company takes guts. Your dad sounds like a cool man!  Thanks for teaching me something new! I stand corrected, waiters in the US DON'T get a salary. I didn't know that. 🤔  They get about $20 an hour in tips. But assuming what you said was true, that servers only live off tips, I think a reform/regulation would be preferable to communism. I haven't heard of people living 100% on tips. ~~Not in New York State. ~~ ~~Most waiters/servers are given a salary, and the tips are a bonus.~~ Additionally, it's an expectation that customers pay an extra 20% for a tip. (Ex. I get $90 of food, so I leave $18 on the table for the tip) A more moderate socialist society is infinitely more desirable. (Ex. Mix of Capitalism and Social Programs) That's not even the full of it. The system gets more and more messed up when you read the real manifesto. Stuff like, The destruction of family, violent revolution, doing away with religion, etc... It also impossible to enforce a communist society without an authoritarian leader. Lies! Bread is love! I had to read the Communist Manifesto for college this fall. It's interesting, but his comments on family, religion, and the outcome of society were ~~unfounded~~ nonsensical. (Edit) Oh dear lord, why is Marx here.  This joycon drift is too much! Lets sue Nintendo  I love the old Robinhood movie! The Whistle Stop intro is my favorite. 😍  You can DM me if you want! Or ping me here if you have a question. Yes! Me too.  Thanks Zackie! I'm glad you enjoy the videos. Much better. I like this bread. This gif makes me uncomfortable. 😐 Thanks! POG RON! Unfortunately, I'm SUPER busy this week, so I don't have anything planned video wise. Bark and Bite finally get to be in the limelight https://tenor.com/view/whats-wrong-whats-wrong-with-you-steve-harvey-gif-4517705 E! Thanks guys.  Unfortunately, no. If I did, then I'd have 50+ friends who I don't know. Ganon = Gangdom Style Take this! 😄 <:old:812790127364931585>  <:Sword1:723962633115664425>  Happy birthday! Wrong channel, but still cool! I went with something simpler than the peck one. Stealth 100 Weirdness is weird. Maybe next time.  Ha ha ha... 😄 I liked it! I believe Waluigi could be in smash!  Why is your username like that... <:mad:730068988301803530> Ditto. 😄 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC11w8ajLyQJiD_69AHnROqQ Actually, he's a subrosian. Shhh... don't tell him. 😄 My arch-rival Nayru I have impersonated other Youtubers, so I understand it. Welcome! Yarg! That be the spirit. 😄 Use sailing vernacular. Powder Moneys, Parrot Eaters, Picaroons Great Scott yes! In-fact, I think this is something they could have been doing since Twilight Princess. But instead of investing in an expansive overworld they invested in elaborate dungeons. Now is their chance to come back! Ah! But I liked Zelda. 😋 https://tenor.com/view/well-yes-but-actually-no-well-yes-no-yes-yes-no-gif-13736934  My old videos with the blueprint backgrounds had a different intro than my current videos.  RIP I didn't read it. Yah, I'm doing HW. So I'm a bit busy.  I didn't see any story (unless you mean the car story) (I'm not sure what was deleted. I didn't do it.) Goodnight! I've had similar concerns with that as an admin. ^ Probably what was happening. You got this! Math is just a form of puzzle solving. Think of it like a game for your brain.  Oh! In that case good luck! Personally, I think Yellow looks cleaner (aka less blurry). So go with that unless you can make red less blurry. ^ [facepalm]  Logo for what?  Sure. Oh! I see. It sounded out of the blue since I didn't have context.  What are you talking about?  Welcome aboard! I'll add that word to the list so people know. It's fine! Start rioting No, it's a sub.  The strike will go away eventually.  You are right, in the future we'll make sure Strikes are told to each member. Oof. 😋 Spam.  Yes it is.  I'll have you know that I INVENTED the Bread % run. I DID, but it's been broken since. We've tried recording a video together 3 separate times. So sort of. https://tenor.com/view/well-yes-but-actually-no-well-yes-no-yes-yes-no-gif-13736934  It's only for people whom I collaborate with in my Youtube career.  Fixed! OH! How did you lose it? Ha ha, I love that one too! It's a shame it gets so few views. Pictures of animals go in   Don't call people stupid. That's rude. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Udo4ZbMZQKY Yah, we were both in the same video.  Random. We already collabed. Remember your skit. 😄 yo You can put it here for now. It's fine. I just mean for my content I don't want to do it. I don't mind when others have sponsors. I think he just acknowledges what I am saying. I don't plan on doing sponsorships anyways. They seem like a waste of air time. Killing = Not good Yah, kinda and me! NOO!!! 😭  Much sad. Is it Zeltik? ^ Yah, you probably were. Sorry about that. Only OG-OG's will remember when we had 1 member. 😄 Me Very! Thank the lord they can't see these comment. Yah! It's alright for them to keep coming. Oh no! Ha ha, good call Ignore it. Yes I play on PC and Wii u No. Or... "Where am I to go me johnies" Country Roads Blue rolled a nat 20 for logic. Welcome Merlin! It's just a huge time commitment. 😅 I think it's fun to respond to comments! So it's not a lot of work. Especially with the gazillion comments people are giving. It's gonna take some time to sift through these. College is a sea monster. Welcome mates! Sorry for the slow greetings on my part. I love the shanties in that game. I know quite a few of them. (Fish in the Sea, Where am I to go My Johnies, Fair Spanish ladies)  I 100% Black Flags last summer. I know Emphoria, so we'll let him have the role. Eee!  Welcome aboard! It's nice to see you here. 😄 I'll consider it. yes Buggers!  I have the same thing happen in American when I use British grammar. "Such as putting a period outside of the quotes". Yes. Please do. That one matters. I enjoyed school. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Yup! It'll figure it out eventually. 😄  Like these guys said ^ Time and work We have a  channel. It's about as good as a fan art channel. 😄 Me is good. Be me. I am he And welcome aboard. Ayy! Thanks Lunar.  Welcome aboard boss! It's an honor to have you here. 😁 Nvm. You're right. Wait. You mean second newest. Nuts. Which video was that? Crap. Need to fix that.  Welcome! I have a video releasing in ~10 minutes I am well!  Welcome! Very weird. I guess I would enjoy being a bunny to if I was eating carrots. No worries! You're just trying to be responsible. I respect that. As long as he acts mature on here. Let him be. I made my first Youtube video when I was 10. You need to be 13 to make a Youtube account. Ha ha, be nice guys. 😄  Welcome!  Welcome! Night everyone! Those comment will need to wait. I gotta get some sleep. Indeed. I plan on not saying "I respond to every comment" in future videos. I'll still do it, but I won't say it. (Exception with this next video) I appreciate the Technoblade reference. And that is regardless of when BotW2 releases. I have enough video ideas to fill a year and a half. Maybe someday. OH. No idea. I don't do lore theories. I don't understand. 🤨 Whoop whoop!  Welcome! Anytime! Could you put these in  Only the hat.  Thanks, but I like this outfit. Mine almost always looks like this. Darn. That is pretty strict.  Welcome!  Thanks! It seems that the "Sheikah Slate Mechanic Everyone Forgot" video is also doing well. Ayy! Congrats!  What? He's old enough to understand how a phone works. Why is that pertinent? Oh gosh! That's terrible.  Welcome aboard! Can I be mod? Ha ha, I'll consider it.  Welcome aboard!  Be nice.  Welcome! I don't have a favorite Zelda game, but I've played Twilight Princess, BotW, and Skyward Sword the most out of the games.  Idunno. I think I got here at 532 or so.  That's not impressive. I get in Discord calls all the time.   Welcome Dune! That would be a fun idea for a speculation video on Breath of the Wild 2! What would the DLC be like? 🤔   Welcome Kroko!  Please don't murder me! https://tenor.com/view/spoilers-tom-holland-spiderman-no-spoilers-gif-12149359  Perhaps more than you realize. 🤔 That's too much math for me head right now. https://tenor.com/view/this-is-getting-out-of-hand-star-wars-viceroy-jedi-sith-gif-11488732  Welcome?  Welcome! Get over yourselves. Dream makes entertaining videos and you all keep watching them. If it aint broken, don't fix it. I like the choice in fonts Very real  Welcome log! I need sleep now. Goodnight maties!  Dear Gosh. I will never edit something like that. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ If it's about pictures, then keep it in pictures. The mods are right. Welcome aboard! Whoops. I am at college. It's fixed now!  Welcome aboard! And thanks for the suggestion. I'll get on that.  Welcome Jax! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWFy8v9snfs  That's a real thing! Croton made a video about it. When you have 1,000 more messages than Goose. Better than I could do. Oh dang. Sure! Ayy! Much better. Thanks for understanding Gojifan! Ow. The burn. But lets not assume things about people. It's alright. You can change it now. Yes, please don't use that profile picture on this server. Everyone commence singing!!  Happy Birthday Pixie! Maybe a sports arena ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ https://tenor.com/view/yes-baby-goal-funny-face-gif-13347383 Can I be an OG? Maybe you're right... 🤔 It'll be hard to top this!  I'm sure it'll slow down eventually. Praying is good! For who? I should clean my kepboard too. Wrong chat. (Yours are good too Lior) Also his videos are good. 😄  Now Random is different. He does Zelda stuff so it makes sense for me to work with him from time to time. You don't even do Zelda content. I don't think it works that way. 🤔 How did you know! Welcome aboard! (Speaking of food. Grapes/dinner guests) I have to get Dinner now. Good luck! And each gamer needs to get the same amount of XP Yup! 665 Experience Points / 19 Video Gamers So you need to make it into a Story! (That's kind of fun) If 95 is a multiple of 19 then you need to use it eventually. 95 - 95 maybe? You just need to multiply 19x5 to get 95. I got to 95 too! I think you're doing it right. My math is coming out the same. It's okay! I'm here to help. 😄 That what a "Story Problem" is? I've never heard of it before. And if you still don't get it right, then that's a challenge to get better over the year. (No need to master it now.) If that's the only problem then just start from scratch and brush yourself off! You can do it Scarf. 😋 Isn't that multiplication? Okay. Are you taking your time with the problems? On paper? On PC? On Calculator? Let me re-word that. How are you doing your math? It's not that simple.  Are you writing it down as you go? You're just having an off day. I am too. What are you doing? Don't say that. Stop spaming. Yah! That is concerning. We're being sarcastic. Lucky. I'm only 2. We're not a small channel anymore, but we're certainly not big.  We have entered the Middle-Child era of our channel. Thanks by the way. Me too. 😳 EAT PARROTS! I'll make an announcement later.   Hey! Thanks Elic. 🥰 You mean "party POPPER!" 🎉  Stop putting memes in the wrong channel Welcome Pika! Sorry. I don't use it. Was that on Twitch? E! Thanks Letme. 🙂 He's using voice to text again. He meant to say "blow up" since we have a lot of messages today. I have to do HW, so I'm going AFK. Just wait another month or two. Nintendo will announce something for the anniversary. Yah, that's a fan project. Sounds like you went through Heck and back. It's nice to hear your doing better, but I'll still pray for you. That sounds nasty. That's an idea! 🤔 Neither of us have a Switch yet. That's a good point! Those are a lot of fun. I just need to find a game to play with my brother while I'm at college. 🤔 Get your head out of the ditch Random! Ditto True, but I'm worried that a lot of the new subs are here for my Breath of the Wild Shorts. If that's the case, I only have 3 of those video. 😅 E! Someone mailed 1000 subs to my doorstep. I'm agreeing with Zeldom. It happened. Her voice sounds older than that. 🤔 I did not know it had a name! (The one about Murphy) I didn't hear anything. 🙄 Maybe it's because mine is part 1? I noticed that too. 🤔  It's so bizarre. I'm not worried about the numbers. I'm more worried about my research right now. I'm looking into the history of Zelda anniversaries (which is quite barren) It doesnt say that at my end. However, I did lose five subs when I released my latest video. I suspect those people subscribed for my "Two Bokoblins Talking" video and wanted another machinima. 😄 Agreed. It's a good schedule! No Hopefully you can find time for Zelda. 😐 Godspeed with that class! Sleep is too important. Ha ha, NO Oh yes! Pfft... nothing. Our sub goal is 500k. 😋 Ah It was hard to tell with the low resolution. Wrong channel. Also kinda violent. I'm a pro-Tingle fan now. Not really. ^ You heard it here first. https://tenor.com/view/confused-the-office-michael-scott-steve-carell-explain-this-to-me-like-im-five-gif-4527435 I am missing context... Poof! Instant Bread. 😄 Welcome aboard!  I don't either. 😄 That'll recover health. Spam eat apples! Then that is good! I'm doing well! How about you tax? I'm not in the market for servers, but thanks for the offer. Interesting. I'll consider it. 🤔 It never released. That makes sense.  I'll look into it then! Thanks for letting me know. Oh! Then that's why I've never heard about it. 😄 Perhaps in DM's? I'm going to get lunch in a minute, so I'll be afk.  Can you explain the game to me then?  Welcome aboard!  Don't be negative like that!  If you would like to prove that via sources, then I'll happily make a video on it, but I don't believe you.  You know that A Link to the Past was release in 1991 in Japan? Right. 4 years before the Satellaview?  That was mean of him. I only mentioned it for a few seconds and then removed it from the list since it's almost exactly like the original. But only briefly. No, 4. I mentioned the A Link to the Past one. I'm sorry to say, I think you're mistaken. There were only 4 BS Zelda games. The ones I listed are all there is. What is it called? Are you sure? What? I only scratched the surface. There is A LOT  By the way, I saw that comment about Ancient Stone tablets. Sorry I didn't talk about it as much. 😅 I didn't want the video to go too long, so I'm saving that idea for later. I want to talk about if Ancient Stone Tablets is canon or not. (Spoiler: No, but I want it to be) It took a lot of reading and research to figure out. I assure you. Gosh! This is awful. It's like a Shakespearean play. 😭 Oh. My cat eats human fingers.  GET BACK TO CLASS That's a dumb cat. Nerf = Life Might be funny. I still need to watch it. I think it looks good. I was about the delete the fish since it's not the memes channel. But he's such an enthusiastic fish I had to let him stay. I'm sorry to hear about that.  😓 You ought to go back and read them if you get a chance. 😋 They were added in subtly and for a short time. But I won't say too much.  That was during the part about St Giga falling apart. I added some letters into the video as a gag. Did you read the letter St Giga wrote to nintendo? E! So many fun sections. 😂 I have a friend that liked the bird part too. That part was a lot of fun. 😄 (Random got a preview) (It's coming out today) That's good to hear. Ayy! I didn't know if you'd be able to watch it in time. On the contrary I enjoy talking with you. I just need to get back to something. Not a problem at all! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I'm busy right now. Eventually... That's a good one! I'll add it to the list. I really ought to add more roles. 😅 Sweet! You need the word "rank" English is dumb. Not you. Very! Existential crises and stuff. Goose is just overreacting a bit. 😄  Welcome about Wooper! It might feel like no one cares, but we do. Not the first time, but a rare sight to see regardless. yes https://tenor.com/view/am-iright-anchorman-ronburgandy-willferrell-gif-5060412 [Deleted cause wrong channel.

Dont do it It's no good Moist. I tried getting people to say "R" instead, and it did not work. It's a thing on this server. As in, "Excitement" E! About time. Probably not Killing them with physics and environmental hazards is still killing them. You wouldn't be able to expand inventory slots since you won't be able to harm the Bokos that stole Hestus maracas. Defeating all the Divine Beasts is what you need to do. Probably. I don't know of any moment you NEED to kill a bokoblin. I don't mind beating them up since I know they'll revive later. ^ Then this https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/722086066596741147/738086509013630986/Samus_is_Serious.gif Bokoblins are a solid pick. They have a lot of personality. I like Linebeck and Navi I haven't watched enough to form a solid opinion. I'm indifferent to anime. Is someone is "Cringy" then they make others feel disgusted and cringe their face. It's not as deep as you're making it. https://tenor.com/view/princess-bride-you-keep-using-that-word-i-do-not-think-it-means-what-you-think-it-means-gif-9201569 Don't be rude like that.

Indeed he is. They're working you guys half to death. Dang. What kinda joint are they running over there? Yesterday's work? BUT overall I am good. https://tenor.com/view/the-office-crying-michael-scott-sad-upset-gif-9816214 But in a superficial way. My tea hasn't arrived yet so I am sad too. Hey Clover! One is Goose. The other is Noose. Nice! <:mad:730068988301803530> Ha, good one. Should we DM? ^ Around that range Sounds much better than yogurt! It's cause of Zeldom's channel mostly. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Yogurt? It's ironic that I became a Tingle convert right after finishing these videos. So proud. 🥰  Mine cat is a killer too! She caught her first mouse recently. And I'm not even done with this format. 😀 Indeed I have! Servers are a big commitment.  Kind of like a pet cat, but weirder and let cuddly. Hee hee, that's right. I don't advertise the discord much since I like keeping it small. But it's always in my video descriptions! Yup! Me and Zeldom are collaborating on a video that's gonna release today (or tomorrow)  Welcome aboard Z! 😁 So much for being "friends" Gosh. I don't have anything I can say except sorry. Ditto ^ One word responses don't explain much. That's a melodramatic response. If you switch accounts again, make sure to drop by.  You got it Clover! One of them is Elephant Vanilla. 🐘 By the way Clover, I caved into the demands of the Orca Chai tea. I bought TWO of them this time. 😄 Morning! {Deleted due to Wrong Channel & Possible Swears} Why not! Yummy. Hot Root Beer. Mary Poppins drinks tea and has super powers. Hence... Tea = Super Powers Tea is great! My favorite pokemon ^ We certainly got a lot of views from that video! Tutorial time! Right? I'm rendering a video. They can only eat a healing item after answering a Bible trivia question correctly. 😄 Speaking of which, this is a fun video released today. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgQlYwU_JyY Jesus is a great guy, eh? That's every soda! :D Yarg! The only thing better than those two things is root beer! They are probably fake. Who knows if these universities exist or not! In most of these studies coffee only has "potential" benefits. Tea seems to have observable benefits. The second page of google! Sounds dangerous! I don't think we should take Google's answer at face value. There are probably hundreds of studies! Sometimes people with ADHD become calmer with coffee. But it's a case-by-case basis. Heck yeah that's awesome! Or does it! I wonder if tea legitimately helps, or if it is a placebo? Yum! Honey. Real mint leaves? Vanilla Chai is another favorite of mine. Good edit. 😋 Still, I got to find something cheaper than orchid chai. I love the whales and all, but the shipping/handling is killing me. I tried buying some other powdered teas. But they aren't the same. What is life without orca chai tea? My life is over Drat. I have some bad news too. I ran out of orca chai tea. I'm going back to college today! Something. Although, I'd love to see you more. That's your prerogative! I'm his successor. The original Bread Pirate is living like a king in Patagonia right now. I am fake. Fake Lior Yeah, tax is cool. Tax is cool. He's a mod here Nope! Totally not a cult about bread. Where do we Begin  Welcome aboard chief! Two holes?  Wait a minute. . . That's the spirit! 😄 How exciting. Very good! I visited my Grandma and got a hot dog. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Here's a screenshot. Thanks! It should be out by Friday. I hope it is! It's a bit better. Not this time! I am editing. 🥷 Indeed. So many bees! Mostly. That's in rule 8  No gore/bloody stuff on this server.  Thanks for catching that. Oh yah, how did I not notice. I have been anime educated. That's horrible. Ew... At least we're friends!  That is a load of stinky. Really? Yah, seems sus  Wait, but she doesn't have the chew toy in her mouth. Doesn't that make her evil?  Nah! It's pretty good. Especially your skits. I think Youtube is fair. My philosophy is that everyone deserves exactly the amount of subs they have. And if you want more then you need to earn it.  Thanks!  ^ https://tenor.com/view/shrek-join-the-club-weve-got-jackets-jackets-club-gif-18326918  Ambitious! I like it.  You mean views? Weak Noodle! Our sub goal is 500k. 5k Sub Video? Why would I do something like that. I just know it will! Worry not! Youtube will bless our channel soon enough. He had 200 Subs when I met him in November. Youtube blessed his channel. E! 5K subs! He's a recent addition to Youtube, but he's gotten big fast. Zeldom! I'm good! I'm working on a collab with another Zeltuber. Wow my service is bad. I'm in the back of a van that's going through the countryside so my messages are coming late. Yay! Yay! I like that idea SlurpPirate! I like building in minecraft as a substitute for lego building. Much cheaper. Discord glitch  Uh oh. Wow! That's cool to hear it's still going on!  😃  I need to keep up with lego news better. I love legos. Even if they are stupid expensive. Are there still new episodes? I watched it when it was starting out. But it's been years since I watched an episode. I'm such a dunce. I thought you were saying you were bad at self promoting your content. Oh. Thats what you meant. 😂 Especially when I'm talking to someone in person! Self promotion is hard to get into. I still have a hard time doing it. Bloody nora. This week we had more views than any other week in our history. Yes https://tenor.com/view/futurama-sospecha-mirada-look-gif-7194479 Sounds sketchy https://tenor.com/view/princess-bride-witch-yell-shout-liar-gif-3884130 Cheat!

I know that shirt design. https://c.tenor.com/5pona7y0qdwAAAAM/shrek-join-the-club.gif But close Nope! Welcome Bruh! Oh no! He has bullet time reflexes!

What is this you're saying about my thumbnail in  😂 Poor greg. 😢 I forgot about that part! Dang son. Goose just got you good.  Heehee, it was lots of fun throwing you into the video. Hopefully it gets people to see your channel. 1 Sub Closer to world domination. We all are! Yah, just ignore Lior. He does that sometimes. Greg can be the next horse I get. I was going to wait until 1:00 to upload Bread%, but if people are getting 11k Views the I need to jump on the bandwagon. 😄 Also catchy song. 😄 I'm fine with this. No visual shows of violence. That's a lot of money just for coffee I think it's beautiful. https://tenor.com/view/finally-about-time-damn-gif-15605541 I'm a slow poke. 🐌 Super Fast Uploads!!! He's a speedrunner on Youtube too. It's a shame I didn't upload my editied bread% speedrun before this all happened. I sent an email to the reporter! Hopefully everything will get sorted out. 😄 Editing is tough Start with Windows Movie Maker OBS only records. Other software. Nah, they chose the perfect topic. 🤩 Us three invented it.  Right! Of course. I'll show them! 😄 I'll have to set them straight! Give me five minutes with em. What the hay. Journalism needs to step up its game. 😄 No idea! But I'm gonna reach out to the reporter and tell them the origins of the run. We made headlines. 😄 Heck yah! I didn't. 😦 Fake Lior They have good taste. https://tenor.com/view/im-here-to-scare-you-straight-scared-straight-scare-you-bully-stare-gif-15661487 I have an idea! Why don't we refresh the spam channel so that we don't count those messages. 💡 Search messages from yourself. And I don't use spam! 😋 5,061 over here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMAiEZ45KrQ That's disgusting. 🤮 hdt376292348509dsfh984efh92o It only gave two characters. 😦 8i What speedrun was it? Arg... sorry about that. Whatever works for you. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ If you did it wrong, It's probably too late. Have you set your audio to a seperate track? I go back 1 week from now!  Hopefully someone takes the bait and applies. Where's this campus. I'll fill the shifts. 😄 Drat! What kind of cowards would abandon Clover! I don't know where this is from, but it is wrong. I've seen a bit of their work. Maybe I could talk to them in the future. 🤔 You watch the basement aye? I hope I will! I'm working on a collab with a fairly big Youtuber (5k subs) & I'm working on a video about Zeltik. 😁 "This isn't bread, it is a sword!" Proceeds to wack parent in the stomach with long bread. Point taken! I'll consider it. Ah... that sounds like it's outside my talents. 😅 It wasn't THAT hard. I made a lot of mistakes in the world record as well. If someone polished the shrines and horse ridding section they could beat it easily. 1st place of the Bugless Great Plataea seemed fast enough for me. 🤔 I was able to do it by studying other people's runs. Strategy is half the battle in a bugless run. Random is great at running. He could beat it. Was my run that good? 😂 He said he was grinding the game to get a better time. I'm so proud of it. But I'm scared that Random Gamer NX is gonna snag it. 😄 In other news, I got the world record! The "Get Bread%" world record. Did you hear about that yet? That's a lot of busy. Whoa. How'd work go? Ayy! Welcome back. creu 😂 Not sure! We'll figure it out as we go. 😄 Hm. . . that's an idea. 🤔 Even if the channel is large, that doesn't mean the Discord has to. 😄  I thought things over and I have decided NOT to advertising the Discord. I  like how small it is.  I already put the link to this server at the top of my video descriptions and I think that's enough to get a small stream of people. I might advertise it in the comments section. https://tenor.com/view/walk-the-plank-pirate-shark-shark-infested-gif-12794000 Bah! It's a good thing we're weeding out the weak pirates. 😄 Whatever you think it best! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  Watch the world record if you're bored, or wait until friday when the pre-world record run gets released.  You mean the pre-world record run which wasn't valid? I loved that run too. Lots of fun commentary. The Bread% on Friday is a recording of my First attempt, so the world record (my second run) won't be used in a real video. yes Can that be changed? Wait, but I speedran on the Wii U. HECK YAH! Do I need to re-submit? I thought I did? YES! HYPE!  Thanks! It's part of a conspiracy. It's gonna be magnificent. It's too late to do that in the Bread%, but after that I can! It might take years to finish them all, but I WILL get to them all. PFFT! That won't stop me. OH! That thing.  From what I can tell it's working. <:Ginger:795436016801546320> It's a lot of fun too. Which thing? I have lots of things. Quicker than 10 years hopefully! 😂 Pretty cool ey? Also, free bread for everyone. 😄 Then the world! Muh ha ha! I think the Theory/Analysis Vids are the easiest to binge. But Relics is also good. 🤔 Heck yah! I also added a new "THEORY/DISCUSSION" playlist. One of them goes on the top, another on the bottom. That way it's easier for people to find. That was fast! They only arrived this week. 😄 Legs are overrated. Peglegs are cool. Unfortunately, Link Lost his legs in the process of the thumbnail. Either or. Here... let me help out. Oh gosh. He lost his abs. 😄  Any word on when the catagory will be added to the website? It'll be out on Friday! I want to keep to a weekly schedule afterall. Is it suppose to be empty? That's still cool! I like the idea behind the teleportation staff. He's a great content creator! Hopefully you find something that strikes your fancy. Me too!  After that I gotta get started on stalking Zeltik. You know... for that one video I told you about. 😉 Hi Wii! I'm doing well. I'm putting the final touches on my Bread% video. But it's cool! It's not the same. 😄 Cake cult! Yummy. Blue Chuchu had one to many chateau Romani's last night it seems. 😒 Wait. When did you leave!? 😄 E? Oh nice! Nice! What's the cult's purpose? That's an idea! We could call yall "Original Pirates" (instead of Original Gangsters) If people watch it. It is good. Haha, no! That can't be it. 😋 Define good Dodongo also eats rocks I start on the 20th! So I gotta get some video making done asap. 😄 I'm in one place. If it were blue I would understand. . . BuT yElloW!? Yellow! What an unfortunate color. The government? Ooo! That's a nice picture. Ha ha, I never thought I'd see someone join Goose like that. Very dangerous! Oh! Ha ha, thanks for stopping by. 😅 Welcome A! Your friend has a problem. 😓 I'd be a tricolor I think. 🤔 But without a crest in the middle. I'm a simple person afterall. What kind of flag would you be?  That would have been fun to edit. Looks like it's not possible to change the "Spam Warning" message Crap. Dodongo doesn't flag me. TEST TEST TEST I have given in to the monster called "Caps" CAPS  I used a Wii U to be precise!  I'm still waiting for the Switch Pro before I upgrade. With a potato? 🥔 Let me know if it doesn't make sense. I used the world record for Bugless Great Plateau% as a guide for the first part. Here is a Microsoft Paint tutorial. 😄 I couldn't find the map, so I'll recreate it. Give me a second.  Yup! I did buglimit as well! It's more fun for me. Let me find the map. Holy moly! That's a long run. You should start with something shorter like I did. 😐 But I did run Bread% and I can safely say I love speedrunning now.  No, that video is next week. I need time to edit it. 😁 #BreadForPresident We gotta rig the system. <:happy:725779401031024641> Yes! That's the spirit. That's a relief. OH! Haha, I was seriously considering delaying the upload just for you. 😋 I was planning on doing it in an hour and a half. When should I upload then? New upload today! Hype! 😁 Yay! Make sure to use it wisely. 😄 Super MonkaTOS "No U" Ahem...

But I like giving it out. Good plan. Pewdiepie collab. Pfft... duh! https://tenor.com/view/eating-hungry-starving-simpsons-sandwich-gif-5880744 That's a lot of subs to eat! Good plan. Random is a mutineer. Everyone stare at him suspiciously.  Not wrong. 😄 Bread Million Subscriber Arc? I will have too. 😄 Nope! Yes. "Exactly" how youtube works.

It's pretty easy if you look it up. Later Green! We blew up a lot of stuff. Then we ate bread. Ouch! Advice taken. Dang! Sorry to hear about that. Is everything alright with your phone now? You're text books look way cooler than mine. Fixed Poo Yes! Maybe? I don't know. Me and Lior just had a pow-wow. We're doing coop a different day this week. But we are all using Voice Chat. Is that alright Goose? Someone was bound to be interested. Not sure why we started this conversation in  when there are +30 people here. 😋 Ask Lior. It's a coop run, but maybe? But I'll need an hour or two before I can do it. https://tenor.com/view/the-time-has-come-michael-scott-the-office-pt_initial-angry-gif-12014939 Aww! Japanese singer right? Totally! The only thing worse than that is being a server owner. 😏  Am I right?! You're right yoshi! But the question is. . . how. Best of the three photos. I like the kitty in the blanket. So cute! Must plunder. https://tenor.com/view/kind-of-a-big-deal-anchorman-ron-burgundy-smile-gif-16393820 I'm a bit of a pixel art expert if you couldn't tell. 😏 I stole Nyan Cat's face and made it into ButterScotch This cat should be the server mascot. This cat has the attention span of a cat. She fast! No... Goose has a point. We will have to add a new role called "Kind of Early Bird" Just remind me when we get there and I'll do it.  Sure! I'll give yall a shoutout. Good plan! 😄 If I live that long. :I I'll be exactly 100 in the year 2100  I answered your question in announcements. 😄 Give me a second... My proudest moment was getting 100 Subs.  I love editing, reading comments, meeting fellow content creators, and the satisfaction I get when a video is done. It's a fun process over all! Ginger is a good name! You mean "borrow" I will! Let me get my sloop ready. You have good taste in cat Lior! OH MY GOSH! It is super cute. I can't remember. 🤔 https://tenor.com/view/horror-disgust-ohno-jimcarrey-liarliar-gif-12183274 More toxic! How is that possible. :I I watch him and FitMC I have no idea what is going on anymore! (With 2b2t) Lots of people. . . o _ o It's outside the scope of my Minecraft abilities, but I want to see that happen. Ooo! That's possible. It'd take a lot of work to make presentable!  It would not work as a survival world since there aren't any minerals in the ground (besides coal). With chickens to boot. And then Rito Village will be a parrot village. 😄 That's a great idea! Holy smokes... Is 2b2t finally updating! Yah! You'll be able to edit them! Probably. :/ But at least we have a base to build stuff! That's a great excuse to play more video games! :D Better than 666 I'll melt or something. I can't survive for three hours without power! I might not make it Yay... I lost power in my house!  Ha ha, someday maybe!  It really did double indeed! D to T? Ha ha, thanks Wii.  Too late Wii! The damage is done. 😄 Happy new year hippies! Flash was all of our childhoods. It was the best of us all. There we go! I fixed it. Oh, that's a joke from my 10 year Anniversary episode. 😄 Ha ha, I like that confidence! (It's wrong, but I still like it!) 2000000 IQ seems large.  Are you sure that is physically possible? 5 YouTubers. Just choose a smaller number Tf2? I want to see this joke play out. Small No No Word = Excusable I'm gonna get caught. :D Uh oh... 😳 What can we do to help your condition? 😄 Oh no! Not Random. . . 😭  I'd pay to see that! I don't want to sleep in past 10 again. Goodnight for REAL Goose. 😄 Ahhh.... You are right. Goose at 1:30 get my brain going. 😋 I love it! https://tenor.com/view/you-full-blown-crazy-crazy-insane-lol-scared-gif-7369894 We're gonna get to 500,000 subscribers Goose! I'm telling yah. it's gonna be great. I'm through with half crapping my videos. We're going to FULL CRAP them! I was under-ambitious!  BUT NO LONGER! (What the heck was I thinking back then) I get like this when I see my old videos. 😄 Our brains ^ https://tenor.com/view/calculating-puzzled-math-confused-confused-look-gif-14677181 I need lots of reminders. Goodnight Goose! And thanks for holding me accountable. A lot of my analysis videos are like. But I don't mind! It's just the way the game works. That's why I'm considering new types of Zelda content that can appeal to a larger audience. Perhaps reaching out to larger content creators. If you'd like I can talk about enemies another time with you! But it's bedtime for me. 😅 No promises. That video didn't do well. That is why the sequel was held back. I'll do it someday, but maybe in smaller parts. One Episode for Enemies One for Items (Or I can use the idea for the Sequel to BotW) https://tenor.com/view/the-office-crying-michael-scott-sad-upset-gif-9816214 https://tenor.com/view/steve-carell-sad-the-office-crying-inside-yikes-gif-9278328 We need more speed! No Switch gang! Whoop whoop! I only know about elgato so I am a bad judge. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ It's not sold anymore, but it called the elgato hd capture card. I think they sell a newer model now. That's enough! Darn it. We'll need to get new guys. (•_•)  That's enough $ to get another Switch Lite! . . .Is a menace. And so is my brother. No! I am. The Hobbit is fun! I've read it and can recommend it if you like medieval fantasy. Fun books? Darn Covid. It's made us deaf to Christmas music. Goodnight everyone! Merry plundering! Me too! Sleep is important, even when Santa is pulling an allnighter. Very good! Soon, Santa will go on a 364 day vacation. Merry Pre-Christmas Gents! I love it when Minecraft gets festive. 😄 I could have easily been wrong. I was lucky. 🕵️‍♂️ I noticed your spelling was really bad. 😁  *Will* instead of *Well* *For* instead of *from* The words sound similar, but are out of place. I know you can type/spell, so I assumed it was machine error. I see! Question: are you using voice to text? (I can't respond quickly today. Lots of house cleaning going on.) You moved on from senko! How come? Watched it already! Very compelling. That's my new name apparently! Whoa! That's an awesome concept. Good. Keep is that way. Elfhiem isn't real. It's equivalent to the CDI Legend of Zelda games. I agree with you about Arc 2. Elfhiem was janky.  I try not to think about it. 😳 Thanks! At least someone agrees with me. 😀 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I've only watched Sword Art Online (Which I am told is a bad anime, although I still love it) and One Punch I'm an anime noob, so thanks for explaining. 😄 Ooo! Nice. What's Demon Slayer? Or afternoon. 😄 Goodmorning Vietnam! Wow What! You're tanking my tail aren't yah? Yes! Good job Arch.  Time to go do wheelies with my dad's truck. 😄 It's a classic! Ooo! That sounds fun. Eww... Sounds like you need a replacement. Talk about it. My old equipment sucked. https://tenor.com/view/no-i-dont-think-i-will-captain-america-old-capt-gif-17162888 Nah, I'll leave it as it is. That would be cool! Oddly, there isn't a listed update on the mod page. Oo... My relics videos might get some attention today. Doesn't look like it. Where did you hear about an update? Seems like it's linked to a Deviant Art meme. Odd.

Ha ha, I guess I'll leave it. it's funny. Yah, It's a bit backwards now that I think about it. 🤔 Soup > Youtube Me too! No U! Heck yah. And now that finals are over I can get back to Wind Wanker 2 No kidding! I'm really behind on Christmas shopping. 😅 6 days! Ayy, nice and seasonal! #FreeMoney #FreeGames Nintendo is wholesome when they aren't a tycoon. Weird.  I watched it as it happened! I love the part when he says "Dad's busy" I wouldn't put  it past them! Hmm... I don't know what to think about this. That's true! Yah... can't be cheating. 🙄 Interesting. Did someone catch Dream cheating? That's a wholesome comment that gives me faith in humanity. 😄 Go kick some Sharepoint butt! Godspeed Arch! Cheese and Bread!? Yah, sure... why not? No idea! But I think it would get crowded if I did that. Thanks Yoshi! That's a lot! It's definitely nicer on the eyes than BLINDING RED and GREEN Thanks! Attempt #2 at Christmas Logo I'm good, thanks! 🎅 I'll be altering it soon, but Thanks! Welcome aboard matie! Glad to have you sailing with us! I need to do HW right now. I'll give that a shot later tonight if I remember. 😅 I'm not happy with it, but I'll keep it for now. All the toys will be ours! I plundered Christmas! None. No glitches! Exactly. Sorry Goose. 😄 [Goose was banned for table flipping] We are running out of tables! Yall guys need to stop throwing tables! What kind of videos do you have in mind? White works for now! It stands out. Good luck with the Discord break! Later Green! This server is *SO* hip. 😎 https://tenor.com/view/dog-piesio-omg-pies-jojo-gif-7549920 Yo yo! Yay! Way to go Clover. Keep looking out for your health. :D How ironic! Hi Lior! https://tenor.com/view/you-you-are-yes-this-guy-your-good-gif-15036437 Wait a minute for it to toast, slap some butter on it, and scarf it down! Toast is a Pogger champ food! In the midst of finals we all need that. 😄 happy weekend tidings to you too Clover! I sure hope I will! Me too. I'm happy to hear your PC is doing better! Ayy! Nice Darn Try it! 😄 That's awesome [ Blue Chuchu is in charge ] [ The Bread Pirate#4334 has left the server] Okay! "how do u leave ur own server" You pass off ownership and then leave. Or ban them! Sue them! Illegal? Where is that written. "i find it fun being around rude people so i can be rude to them" Bad example to the kids Yoshi! 😂 🥳 🎊 🎉 Let's throw a party! https://tenor.com/view/genie-free-me-freedom-aladdin-youve-been-set-free-gif-12118740 Flip Bombed? https://tenor.com/view/smart-meme-think-about-it-gif-7906618 Are you really a mod if you can't ban people? Can't read the messages  Why can't you leave the server? Yah. Very blurry. I hate it when my mail is the color black. I want my mail to either be white or brown (cardboard) So why can't you leave the server?  That's pretty toxic sounding. *Sniff armpits* I don't smell that bad do I? ^ Yah! You might get radiation poisoning! Well, that is IF you start a new account. Regardless, you're always welcome here.  If you go through with deleting your Discord account then make sure to join here again! I'll get your mod position back to you. Mine too, but most of them are in essay form so I have to get started on them now. Just wacky! What kind of school would do that. Good thing it's a Friday! In other news, I have too many ideas for videos and not enough time. I need to get over these finals. That's impressive! You are your own alarm clock. Not Waluigi... but soon enough we'll get him. I can't give a definitive answer for all countries and states since the answer depends on the place. You'd need to do some research.  Europe is responsible for a lot of the names we have in the world since they colonized so much. Oh! I was right. Nice Americano Vespucci? I don't remember either. Some names come from people. Rome for instance was named after the founder. And "America" (the landmass) was named after a cartographer. Some places are named after languages. Lots of answers. Need sleep. Whoa. Big question. https://c.tenor.com/o13D9VLmfaQAAAAM/shocked-dr-phil.gif Hey, don't copy me 😠 Both https://tenor.com/view/cat-kitten-scold-no-nope-gif-10719296 That's it. You're grounded. No more finals for a whole MONTH! Gosh Darn it Clover! Again? I used to watch Stampy and Iballistic Squid collaborate https://tenor.com/view/sad-upset-violin-sponge-bob-mr-crab-gif-3388117 Crike. Well it's a good thing you got it back.  Where did you find it? I have to delete comments like that once in a while.  Did you find your Animal Crossing Cartridge? Man overboard! Hmm... I have no answer for this problem. Doesn't look like there is a solution. But it also looks like this is a semi-good thing? Lets make sure to combat the dislike bots with our own likes! I like your music! What about your teacher? They seemed to like your music. They sure are persistent. How in the heck would your school have found your new channel already! The video wasn't offensive. So that can't be it. Maybe there's something we're missing. 🤔 I wonder why? https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCefqw24tN27n_wXp432fCw What is that search engine? it looks different. Well, to be fair, his channel just started. ^ Me christening the new channel! https://tenor.com/view/sherk-accident-boat-champagne-opening-gif-18495451 I subscribed! Godspeed with the new channel! I didn't know you had that username in Minecraft! That's good @_Lior You could also try something simple like "Lior Gaming" or "Lior Game" I tried going with a latin username when I was 13. "Sitludo" It didn't go very well since people thought my channel was spanish. In early 2016 I watched **The Princess Bride** for the first time and fell in love with it. One of the characters from the movie is named "The Dread Pirate". Thus, one day I decided to use that as a username for a game of Terraria, but I accidentally used a B instead of a D. I thought it was hilarious, so that same day I made a new email and later a Youtube account to replace my old one. (Old username was Major Burton Wester) My name was made from a type. (Give me a secod to type the full story) The Music Pirate Why would someone eat that! Gross. I've done option 2 around 3 times. It's a viable option. Option 1: Make what you want even if people don't want to see it. (Ron is right. When you're a small channel you shouldn't commit to one type of content) Option 2: Make a new channel and don't delete the old one. (Keep it around for historical purposes. The music on it is good.) https://tenor.com/view/dont-you-dare-dont-dont-do-it-the-office-michael-scott-gif-14178027 Why would you do that?!  NO! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_de_Mahy,_Marquis_de_Favras#:~:text=Often%20seen%20as%20a%20martyr,of%20his%20death%20sentence%20warrant You sound like that french revolutionary that pointed out the grammer errors on his death sentance.  Yah, it seemed quirky to me at first. But it makes a lot of sense. If an admin could edit the messages of members, then who is to say they won't mess with the meaning of other people's messages. I could delete the word "No" in a message and completely reverse the meaning of a sentence. So I prefer a system where comments are deleted completely.  Bots can only do so much.  The only person who can edit a message is the person who sends the message. So the only way for a bot to delete a swear word is by deleting the entire message. If you find this to be annoying then you will need to contact Discord's developers because I cannot fix it.  The bot deletes swear words since this is a family friendly server. If you're interested, here is the list of blacklisted words... (Will be deleted in a few minutes) It occured to me that I should add a spoiler cover to that. (Anyways, sleep now) Your channel has awesome music. I'd hate to see that disappear. Why are you deleting those?  Have fun? I have to go to bed, so i'll see yall in the morning. Fair points.   Dungeons were much different, but at least we can agree there were dungeons in the game (Hyrule Castle for instance was phenomenal) The bosses were not challenging for some, but the same could be said of bosses from older Zelda games. The differences is that BotW's bosses required less puzzle solving to defeat. I agree, Side Quests sucked. I don't have much to say about that one. I made a video about it a while ago where I go into more depth on ways of fixing them if you're interested. It's ironic that you say it is too nonlinear, but I agree with you. Zelda 1 had a better balance of linearity and openness in my opinion. It gave you the freedom to go down whatever path you wanted, but the paths were linear. BotW on the other hand has no paths. It is a sandbox. This conversation has got me interested in making a video. I'll experiment with a script on it. I might even take the video in a different direction. Who knows. I thought BotW was a fun game, but you must have noticed something I didn't.  What is it that holds BotW back? What does a Zelda game need to have to be good? https://tenor.com/view/you-you-are-yes-this-guy-your-good-gif-15036437 No idea! Only Nintendo will tell. _is afk now._ Everyone has a preference (which is okay) and BotW is still a Zelda game. Just not a traditional Zelda game. Hardly a debate at this point. We are just observing the obvious. There are Top Down perspective Zelda games Side Scrolling Zelda games 3d Traditional Zelda Games 3d Open Air Zelda Games (The BotW type) It's a Zelda game, but not a traditional Zelda game. The issue is that Nintendo has MANY types of Zelda games. BotW is just a new type. I think my best right before I go to bed. So you are on to something. Yes... yes it does. 😄 I have a hard time saying which is my favorite. Twilight Princess was my first game, and I have finished it the most. Yet I see it as a flawed game. I've played a lot of games, but I've only beaten a handful of them. __Beaten Games__ - Zelda 1 - A Link to the Past - Ocarina of Time - Twilight Princess - Skyward Sword - BotW __Played But Unfinished__ - Zelda 2 - Majoras Mask (I almost beat this game 2 times, but I had two separate controllers break down and make the game unplayable.) - Wind Waker (Right now) - Minish Cap I had that happen the first time I played it. But I'm enjoying it this time. I bet that the ability to control cuccos was supposed to be similar to the ability to control seagulls in Wind Waker. But development time must have cut the mechanic short. They do not. Instead, if you hit them enough times then you get to control one for a short time. In case you didn't have enough trauma from cuccos already. 😄  Welcome aboard! https://tenor.com/view/kitty-highkitten-mdmacat-cat-happykitty-gif-6198981 Here. Have a cat. I'm sorry about that clover. Nice! Ha ha, that's awesome.  Thanks Lior. 😄 Pfft, face cams are weird. No thanks. Thanks! Sorry it was short, making those subtitles took ages.  Your secret is safe with me! @everyone The Premiere is starting in less than a minute! That's a lot of subs. That was called "Zelda Mods Destroyed Me and My Brother's Relationship" I'm 20, he is 19 No, I'm the older brother. 😄 No, 1 year apart. Good thing we added subtitles to the whole episode! Maybe a bit less, but I thought it was a week ago. About a week ago. It was a subtle operation and I only mentioned it once in General Darn Goose is right! There's a premiere for the video in 5 hours. I'll be making an announcement shortly before it comes out so that people can join in. That's a perfect description Get some food for my brain . Time to get to class! Good morning Clover and Elic! Yah, he left. But green potions are cool! Man overboard! Yes, the typo is intentional. 😄 (But I think it will be amazing) (Unless it isn't) It's going to be amazing! Huh, weird and cool! Darn it. I was sure it was green. We'll miss you Green! But we're always rooting for you.  Good luck with school! But they only offer a limited amount of repairs before they charge you. Let's hope so! Nintendo has been quiet about the Pro Joycon drift is the reason I'm holding off on buying a Switch. I want to see more news on the Switch Pro  It's a fun idea! I'll make sure to consider it. I like this bird or owl? Loftwing. Ayy! Congrats! That's one step closer to victory. That's a fun theory! I like that. I might be remembering things wrong. Let me double check. Zelda might be a bird or a fox. Remember A Link to the Past's concept art? Don't join the dark side. Come back to the light! (Windows) No! How could this be! It's a bit random. But in the future I might make it more systematic. Once in a while I check to see who's active. And i give it out to community members. Lets add some more Member + people. Good times.  Are you refering to when you got the Member+ rank? Yah! I see the similarity Yes I do. 😋 Frogs are funny. Yah, sorry about that.  No. Yah, they're just hugging. Right? They don't do much. Yah, those are just frogs. Goodmorning Yoshi! Play the demo first. Oh yah. I forgot about the demo. Oh snap! Those are nice savings. Why else wouldn't I have bought a Switch. 😄 Heck, I can't blame you. I'm stingy with my cash too. I haven't played it (since I still lack a switch) but I did watch the cutscenes. There are about 2 hours worth of cutscenes in all. I was talking with another Zeltuber who said they cried when they got to the end.  Granted, they seem like an emotional person, but they did cry! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloczNwhmrc Music is also catchy. Here's a no-spoilers track based on Revali's theme... You'll probably have fun with it. The plot is phenomenal by Zelda standards. Have you been spoiled about the game's plot yet? Have fun with it. I really want to play it someday. No way! I've never finished Wind Waker so I'm SUPER excited! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I'm planning on recording Wind Waker with my brother later today, so hopefully those videos will do well. I'm going to blow up? Sounds painful. 🤯 By the way, Happy Thanks Giving Everybody! (In America) 🦃  Ha ha, maybe. There's no telling what the future will hold! Or sleepy time vanilla. Yah, Vanilla Chai is really good in my opinion. Goose has a point. Tea isn't always the best before bed. It depends on the person. Vanilla tea is my favorite. Oh, you're right. How silly of me. I always drink Chai. What a funny looking tea. I have to got to bed. (It's WAY past when I usually go to sleep) Night Yoshi! It was nice talking with yah. And I hope you can beat the boredom. Ha ha, amen. We can all use free stuff. 😋 This does too! The creator used to be a comedic Youtuber so he's got a fun style of doing dialogue. You'll notice that my channel is entirely Zelda content except for my series on Applewood. It's a game I have a lot of love for. Applewood is similar to Undertale in a lot of ways, but it's cuter and not as wacky. And the ending has a big twist. https://tenor.com/view/michael-scott-wink-yes-%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%81%E0%A4%96-%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BE-gif-5795910 https://store.steampowered.com/app/1107470/Applewood/ If you have Steam, I would suggest trying out "Applewood" It's a free, 2D, puzzle game that is inspired by Zelda. It was made by one person over the course of 5 years and deserves more attention. There is much to do, with many unknowns waiting to be discovered. BotW is a great game, but you should try branching out. See new horizons. Explore new genres! https://tenor.com/view/can-i-get-a-hallelujah-hallelujah-happy-celebration-gif-4119738 That's similar to my PC. Sounds like a solid build. Ooo! AMD card. Nice. That's what my brother got. {AFK for Dinner now} I'm sure you can figure it out fine, but be warned that there is always the possibility of something going wrong. We used that. 😅 Best Buy was able to figure it out though. Yah, for some reason the PC was able to run properly, but its BIOS didn't display. So we couldn't install Windows. That is true. But my brother ran into a problem with his display. We needed to take it to Best Buy to get it fixed, but we tried to fix it ourselves for 2 months. I will admit that building a PC is a lot riskier. Me and my brother both ran into issues when building our PC's but thankfully we got them fixed without buying new parts.  Yes! So I blurred out the words.  Godspeed Ron! I can't wait to see how your videos do in the future. 😄 Once you get a tower consider getting Davinci Resolve. It works on mac and it is free. It'll be hard to get used to, but once you learn Davinci then you'll be able to do almost anything that a professional Youtuber can. Mac can be tricky, but I'm sure there are editing softwares to use. What kind of computer do you have? (Laptop or PC Tower?) Also note, editing can mean a lot of things. You don't need to cut footage out if you want to edit. You could instead add pictures/text/sfx to the footage you have. What! Since when were edited lets plays bad? 😂  Most Minecraft Youtubers edit their lets plays at least a little bit (EX. Grian/Mumbo Jumbo/FitMC). Whether that is skipping boring parts, adding music, editing narration, or adding special effects. In fact, I was just talking with another Zeltuber who explained that they take time to edit all of their lets plays despite them being mostly uncut footage. There are so many ways to improve footage after it is recorded. I am biased since I edit my footage, but I think you should consider editing your footage (at least a little bit). Which part is the most fun? I like the editing. I like to think about my older videos that way. Then are you doing the series as a Diary to yourself? Oh, darn. What about viewers? Have they been enjoying it? Ha ha, speaking of which, how is the series going right now? Will this be for the letsplay? Ah. Unfortunately, I think mining with a fortune pick is the best way. And that's difficult to get. You could use kelp as a fuel source. Subliminal messaging is when you tell something to your viewers indirectly. It's a joke since you're not being subtle with your messaging.  Nice subliminal messaging. 😄 On break? Ahoy Clover! Long time no see. How's college? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Elic's got it. I'll consider adding it! My throat does that a lot. 😄 Oh! I see. You mean that I am dying, not Link. Ha ha, no, I mean which part of the video as in "Minutes and Seconds" Wait, which part of the video is that? (Time wise) Must have been a glitch https://tenor.com/view/parks-and-rec-parks-and-recreation-ron-swanson-gif-5603552 2 Hours! You're at least 7x faster than me. Poop Ten years ago I was ten. Don't say sorry, I like getting pings like these. Thanks Yoshi! If it's an Old Spice ad that makes sense. And those yummy bread rolls. You mean gravy day. 😄 Ha ha, I'll be doing the same this thankgiving. So in other news.... 😳  Anyone have a SPECIFIC MOMENT they liked from a video that they would like added? True! Neither gang won. We all did.  I love those too! But is there a funny part to the gun video that belongs in the 10 Year Anniversary video?  Is it because it has guns in it. 😏 https://tenor.com/view/thor-banhammer-discord-banned-banned-by-admin-gif-12646581 Did someone say meme? That's the worst type of pirating! Arg.. scurvy bilge rats.  😖 Nice! Good luck growing! I don't have an answer to that.  Just do it. Eating pizza can result in horizontal growth if eaten in excess. So life is good! I'm eating pizza In America it depends on the school. For me, Middle School began in 7th Grade (this is when you get lockers and multiple teachers), and in 9th we began High School. Oh! That explains things. I don't know these things about Canadian society. Wait, really? You have no idea what class you fell asleep in! 😂   How did you not see the teacher? History Class? Math Class? English? I'm a Roaring Twenties kid. Yay! I do too. 😄 Yah, if you search "Killer Bunny of Cerbanog" I think it will come up. I'll share it in Picture/Videos. Same as the Holy Hand Grenade in Terraria. Yup! Only summoning with console commands. Brain storming I see! Possibly, but that is not a concern for the server right now. It's a Zelda focused channel after all! We'd need to get a lot more people involved before we made a server. Not consistently. 🖐️ Don't take what I say as fact. There are probably exceptions. I think being a monster is biological. Monsters are characterized by glowing eyes, sharp teeth, and exploding into smoke upon death. I would prefer a boss that you can summon or find. Random encounters can be annoying when too frequent or too rare. Consider the Yiga Clan encounters in BotW. More things being added wouldn't hurt Minecraft.  It just gives people more to do, right? I want to Killer bunny added in again. Terraria could teach Minecraft a thing of two I believe. The variety of armors and number of boss battles for instance would be a nice addition to Minecraft. They were alright if I do say so myself. The one you know and love! It's hidden in a playlist right now. I unlisted the videos so that it didn't cluttered the channel but you can still watch them. I had a series about it for a short time.  Nice avatar! I approve of Terraria. Alts from Jcross https://tenor.com/view/well-yes-but-actually-no-well-yes-no-yes-yes-no-gif-13736934 Yah, that didn't explain things. Sorry to break this to you guys. I'm very sorry. It doesn't help when you can't see what the quotes are. This feels wrong. I don't like these quotes either. We'll see about that. 😅 Ouch, that's gonna be a tough run  Yah, I don't do Youtube for money. If I every make money off of Youtube in the near future it's going to be through ads, not asking for donations. Yup! Gotta get them new subs somehow. 😄 Back in November in fact! Of course, I was doing Age of Calamity months before him. PointCrow stole my idea and did it better. Ah yes, a lot of people came from there... 😄 But time is messy to keep track of. Feels like a while. Thank you Des! Ha ha, no rush.  Thanks!  Oh no!  How did you get that picture of me! I'm glad Matpat stands up for other creators, even if he is obsessive about FNAF. 😄 It's inconceivable! The Bread Pirate came from a typo of the name from the Princess Bride. Sorry, I got busy with a project. Yup! The Dread Pirate was an inspiration for The Bread Pirate On mobile it is trickier than on PC I am blind. Add that to the list. Dysentery is a sickness from bad water. Scurvy is from lack of vitamins. I'm a pirate. Jcross is nervous about giving out his age. You can talk to people in it. Well... for starters. This is a Discord Server. https://tenor.com/view/apple-bite-fruit-eat-barbossa-gif-9227323 More like scurvy. Yarg! 🟠 Ages. 😄 I identify as a 1700's kid. Welcome Des! https://tenor.com/view/joke-jk-penguin-laugh-its-was-a-joke-gif-14574338 I believe Arch is in his mid 80's, but I'm just guessing. 😂 Oh, thanks. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I don't remember. I'm 20 Wow, that was evasive. 😄 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Nuts. Now you are the head cook of the ship. 🍎 Upside down eggs taste just as good. Ramen and meat? Sounds tasty! Wow...! It's funny that when I first saw Minecraft I assumed it was a shooting game since it was in first person. I mistook Steve's arm for the end of a gun. 😄 I can't begin to tell you how iconic that video is for me. I remember my friends in elementary school playing that song all the time when we went to the computer lab. Ha ha, that's awesome. 😄 *comedy.* No, the other one. Reminds me of another corona  Oh! You're the one who updated the Wiki! I just saw your comment. Thanks again for doing that.  Welcome aboard! The Robin Williams commercials will never be topped. What a magical time to be alive. I missed out. Good ole pogs. 😄 You're been tricked Elic. All of you have. 😇 Think about it. You're literally saying, "600 Play of the Game" It's not proper english. That's a weird way of putting it. 😅 > Frozen bananas can do the same.  Considering the most recent video on the channel, that is a perfect ingredient. 😄 I agree. Lets get this milk. Yes Time to beat them up and steal their milk money. New York is adding more rules too. Is that in New York state? Blenders are a gift from heaven. I love smoothies. Important stuff. I suppose that changes from channel to channel as well. Careful, that's a dark path... 😉 Tis true! It was April I agree! Also I was thinking of the wrong month. So my video skyrocketed in views. He uploaded a Relics of the Past video after I did. That must have been Point Crow month. Thanks! My sister plans to do it right before 1,000  My brother and sister joke about UnSubing all the time as a joke. Ha ha, thanks Nim. 😄 Time to unsub! You forgot the word "rank" Color roles. No, not that. I mean the / ones. Ha ha, only the bottom three work. Nice have fun with it! Hopefully I'll be able to drop by. I tend to ignore it when this happens. It doesn't mean anything. Have fun! https://tenor.com/view/umm-confused-blinking-okay-white-guy-blinking-gif-7513882 Were you doing that this whole time? I'll leave this stuff to the professionals... like Random NX! It's the timing that messes with me. I've never bullet time jumped so I think this is above my skill level. 😅 That's nuts. I can't believe mods take up so much. So many...! I agree. Sometimes that gets too tedious. No idea! Rocks for the win! Who would have thought that was possible. That's wild! 👍 Thanks for letting me know! The setting were off. Try again I'll make sure you have early bird as a role.  Sorry to break this too you, but the streaming roles has been dead for a long time. Anyone can stream if they want to. Great Scott! Do you need any roles? Man overboard! 60 FPS looks so silky compared to 30 Very! Thanks! I was rendered in 30 FPS for this video, but next time I'll be using 60 FPS so it looks smoother. They were fun, but they also took a long time to make. I'm looking forward to an easier intro. Go watch an older video then. It's okay, no tables need to be beaten anymore. They can go out and live freer lives. Thanks! Thanks Scarf! I think this latest video was worth the all-nighter it took to make. 14 straight Hours of work later. 😄 Sweet! Do it. Congrats! Good enough. 😋 https://tenor.com/view/obama-mic-drop-largar-o-microfone-gif-7413222 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_gZ87ZyETs&feature=youtu.be I did! I would LOVE it. Heck yah. That would have been rough. So much re-doing! That has to be annoying. How did that sweater end up? Like you should! ^ Clover when yarn goes on sale. https://tenor.com/view/6m-rain-wallstreet-make-it-rain-gif-8203989 That's like free money! Oh, that's nice then. 😊 https://tenor.com/view/what-sponge-bob-shocked-confused-what-the-gif-12645964 You what! Yay! Sleep! https://tenor.com/view/cat-typing-when-chatroom-is-lit-busy-funny-animals-gif-14793461 Ahoy! NO. Ha ha ha... The script so far. Already did. 😄 I'm doing great! I'm writing a script as we speak. Sorry about that! Can you? No, but you can technically ban most people. Should you? No. https://tenor.com/view/michael-scott-wink-yes-%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%81%E0%A4%96-%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BE-gif-5795910  Are you sure? I approve! Ha ha, lets hope he didn't have to work in a sweatshop! Ah, so not fun. That's a fun assignment! Encourage them.  Thank you Elic, but that won't be necessary. 😋 Welcome to the crew! Well, it actually is my fault since I pulled the plug on the series, but I see what you're saying. 😄  Sorry about disappointing you. With that news, but I'm hoping to do a Wind Waker run in the same style soon. Oh! Nice. Yah? It ended after episode 3 in season 2. Crap. Well I'll add the word "Finale" to the last episode. I guess I didn't make that clear? Yup! Has been for a while. Oh nice! It seems like a lot of people started with that video. I don't know if the project is still being worked on. I haven't spoken with the creator in months. But I am finished playing it. (Note: The Ilama Bean Inqusition eventually became The Bread Pirate Gaming. The Zelda Channel you know today)  Yes, but actually no! -It started off as Webcam videos when I was ten.  -When I was 13 I started my first letsplay with a 480p capture card (Twilight Princess) -I did several letsplays until I was 17. -I made a few Zelda U theories (What would eventually become BotW) -In 2017 I tried being a news caster for a Multiplayer mod for Fallout New Vegas -I made a channel called The Bread Pirate and another called The Ilama Bean Inqusition (Collaborative gaming channel) -I started Relics of the Past -Today But I didn't get serious about it until this year. 10 years this Dec 24th. I treat all people the same, fan or no. So it hasn't affected that.  I have never had that happen. Not in person at least.  English?  Why thank you! Ha ha, no. **Fame** has not made a difference in how I view Youtube, life, or family. I don't consider myself famous. No, there is no point to life anymore. I have failed Tax You made my type for 2 minutes about family... That's what fam is. Wait, I thought we were talking about family? Yes, for the better. New name, I didn't notice it! We're the Pirates that don't do anything! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaWU1CmrJNc But good pirates! The Scarf Pirate was a name for a while I think.  I love it! 😄 https://tenor.com/view/darn-stephen-colbert-gif-11755531  What was your sad thing today? Amen Brother! I am a Wii U owner! But I don't make fun of it because I genuinely enjoy the console. It looks the best when in full screen mode. I'm leaning towards the middle one.  Gone, reduced to atoms.  Yes I do! It's called a Wii U  You got a point!   Tried it. It didn't work. [Banned for @] 😋 Yes! What clover said. 😄 Not sure if it will happen, but I would love that. That would be really cool! (Aside from soldiers/allies) Is it? It's not a traditional Zelda game if you've seen the demo. I think the only NPC's we'll see are in cutscenes and on menus. You have a point! Ha ha, touche. You have a point. There is still a lot to fix. But BotW won't be a big deal once Age of Calamity comes out. Plus, I think it'd be fun to try delving into new topics! Just to experiment and see what I would like to do in the future. The Fixing BotW series can't go on forever after all. 😄 Stop Fixing BotW. Alright, now I need someone to tell me if I'm crazy or not for this idea... I can get Among Us on it, no worries. I would use my phone. > Petition for bread to get among us and record a video with me  We'll see. :D Ask me again in a week when I'm done with my draft paper. Freezeflame is a classic. I like it too. What? Me wants freetime.  I does homework. Pretzels are the highlight for me! I don't see why not!  That sucks so much! What a banana brain. Ayy nice! It looks really good for a drawing. I have monopolized the bread market of thumbnails. Heck yah. 😄 Lose your Nitro? Sorry, but the eyes were freaking me out. 🙃 It did. Great scott! Wait... Do some bonding. Record memories. That's what I say.  That's wonderful! I love it! If someone over 28 uses an upside down emote, it means "silly" If a psycopath uses it, they want to twist your neck. Depends on the person using it.  I wish you the best of luck with your Age of Calamity content! I hope you get a big spike in views.  You jokester. You had me fooled for a second. 😄 Not Promo Wha!?! No way! I can't wait to see how it turned out. Should be a blast. 😄 Oh, I will play it.  No doubt. Ouch. Sorry about that. I sensed confusion in your text! What are you thinking Goose? In case things weren't confusing enough, I changed my Standard Profile Picture on Youtube. It's a bit of a test so see how people like it. Personally I think the black and white is awesome since it reflects a pirate flag, but I'm up for criticism. 🏴‍☠️ It's funny how quickly people grow attached to a profile picture. I only had it for a few weeks. 😄 Noted Mine? R is best! R for Arggg...! I'm sorry for you, but to be fair you have the name "noose" in your name. They stole it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL3H7CUJMDU asdfmovie13 Has a reference that's similar to your name.  How long have you had that username? [Deleted for possessing spam like qualities.]  Perfection! No, because you made a typo. So your comment is invalidated. Arch pointed out as much. The UAE flag has a Red/Green/White design. Oh, nice. Really? Wait, why did Aladin come up!? This is the Christmas logo A turkey... 🤔  Not sure if that works with my logo. I'd need to think about that. During Christmas it will be. I'll change it for now. It's confusing people. Fair point. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  Why all the gun spam? Whoops. Sorry Arch. No! Don't delete discord! Tax, I'm sorry, but I don't understand. Not worth the effort. Be yourself. Maybe! I don't have an IPhone so I don't know. > How are y’all  I'm great thanks! College is first though. I really want to do the Bread% as well.  Looking forward to the bread % run. I'll be ready to run it as soon as you are! Jeopardy will never be the same. 😢 I just heard! https://tenor.com/view/throw-computer-mad-rage-gif-7885195 Oh, that's great then! I'm happy to hear it's durable. (Ex. Joy Con Drift) Yah, it's scary. The quality of their consoles has gone down too. A switch doesn't last nearly as long as older consoles. Then we'll get the Disney Vault treatment. I don't want that. No... Wait... Give it a few decades, there's no telling what will happen. Who knows! Maybe some day Nintendo will stop making consoles and will make game for PC. Then things will be way easier to play.  No!! It's not possible to download FSA anymore. It was available for a short time though. It was! Me as well. The Oracles games are hard to get your hands on. Same with Four Swords Anniversary edition. Yup! I believe the Oracle games took a lot of inspiration from Ocarina of Time's characters. I never realized. 😄 Good point. I wonder why dot eyes work on Derp Link, but not BotW Link. 🤔 No less soulless than Derp Link. Fixed https://tenor.com/view/surprised-pikachu-pokemon-shock-surprised-pikachu-gif-15357817 I believe he's a sidequest character, so he doesn't have a lot of creep time in Oracle.  He is unbelievably creepy. But in the Oracle games he's less creepy. It's the Happy Masked salesman from the Oracle games. I made a typo *can't Goodness, imagine if I forgot to breathe. Or drink water.  HW is a lot, but I cant imagine letting it dictate my eating habits. **Forget!**  Make sure to eat more regularly in the future. We care about your health. 🥺 You go Clover!  (Wait, does this imply you weren't eating previously?) https://tenor.com/view/cat-typing-when-chatroom-is-lit-busy-funny-animals-gif-14793461 I'm doing HW, so I'm not going to be able to stick around for long conversations. Happy Saturday! Ahoy Clover!  I don't think that works the way you think that works. 😄 What emote didn't work? I am fine with Biden fans being excited, but it can feel like "rubbing it in your face" to some people. I didn't like any of the canidates. I want to get past the election since it's not a cheery topic for everyone.  Most divided Country in the world? I think Korea, Yemen, Ghana, and South Africa would like to have a word with you. 😄 I miss George Washington. I don't want the election to become a debate in politics. I want policy to dictate decisions. Congrats to Biden. Now let's get past all this. 😅 Yee! :D Not quite. It was Lior. I deleted it because I felt the comment was rubbing too much salt into the person who actually posted chewed food. https://tenor.com/view/facepalm-really-stressed-mad-angry-gif-16109475 Rule ten used to be 9, but it got bumped down. Rule 9 is new to the list. You said it Elic! Whoop whoop! Just finished a ton of my 14 page essay today. Now I can relax  Interesting idea! I'll consider it. I wonder how I could keep the smacking element, while keeping it professional? I'll look into ways the smack sound effect can be kept, but no promises. Actually, the introduction sound is from Twilight Princess! It's the sound that plays when you catch a small fish. I'm thinking we can adopt a shorter 2-3 second intro. The slap intro is fun/quirky, but it's not as professional as the rest of the video. People want to see Zelda, not doodles. 😄  Thank you for the consent. :D  I'll get that fixed right away! Well nuts.  Happy Birthday boss! Trump is done after this election. He's too old to run again. I'm considering emailing/contacting the devs to learn more about the game before I sink $25. I would love to support them though. I really love the art style. The combat doesn't look interesting yet, but the world seems large.  What is 2.5D?  It's a Kickstarter for a Zelda 2 inspired fantasy game.  We're talking about the early access game Arch shared. 😋  The one right above my message. $25 is a steep price for an early access side-scroller. I saw that article yesterday, and I'm wondering if I should invest in it. 🤔 Presidents change, but God remains king! https://tenor.com/view/good-morning-the-office-michael-scott-vietnam-steve-carell-gif-16399361 https://tenor.com/view/iunderstand-gif-5611225 Thank you! But I'll pass.  That's a mentality I haven't heard recently. 🤔 Most Youtubers I listen to say, "I only upload something I would watch myself!" but uploading something to let people know you're alive is valid.  Man, you're really not selling this video. 😂  It must not be THAT boring. Otherwise you wouldn't have uploaded it, right? Man overboard!  Happy Birthday again! (I already said H-B Day on facebook. 😄 ) I love the Princess Bride, and would love to flex my obsessive knowledge, yet I need sleep. Godspeed maties! https://tenor.com/view/over-the-garden-wall-otgw-animation-margueritte-grey-gif-10881080 I love bread and stealing. Me too. I date my calendar a lot. I haven't dated. And I'm a Sophmore in college. There's no rush. Bread is best. End of conversation. Whoa. They need sleep.  Could you share some examples?  That was the anime character in your PFP right? O.O  I didn't realize you did thumbnails too! That's fun.  Have fun shopping!  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yYMAvi7DGuIFSCv_UzVAkGXxTlSiExc1/view?usp=sharing I can send you a file download?  Cheesey Louis-y. That's a lot of standing. Amen. You get some rest. Work is exhausting. Lucky! Sure!  Thanks Ron! I've always been curious how people do that stuff.  How do you get poses for Minecraft models?  I'm doing awesome! Thanks for asking.  That's fine if you want to be the meme guy! We don't have one of those yet. 😄 https://tenor.com/view/pongo-yay-101dalmatians-clock-countdown-gif-11676332  That's fantastic! Glad to hear it went by fast. Ayy! Same! Which one? 😮 BotW2 chat > Can we have an aoc chat :p  Done I don't think the @ worked. I'm not sure though. I don't know. This seems kind of sus. https://tenor.com/view/sus-fry-futurama-gif-4691459  Nice Dinner! My family has the same plate you have. 😄 I'd by a Nintendo Switch What in the... Whoa! It's like a cold war spy novel. 😄 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_the_Terrible The terrible. Happy listening! Sorry boss! Can't join right now. Man overboard! OBS is a solid choice. You won't need to switch to a different software until you get 100k Subscribers. Oh, whoops. I thought you asked about Editing software. I didn't read it correctly. I use OBS also!  I use Davinci Resolve 15. It requires a lot of CPU power to use, so unless you are using a high performance PC don't bother. It is free.  Yes. This is a family friendly server. No cussing or NSFW please. If you went to the website I said, it should be safe. My guess is that it can't be scanned because the file size is too large. That happens a lot too me. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Getting a rom is a whole different beast. I cannot help you with that. https://cemu.info/ I use Elgato HD Capture card.  They don't make the one I use anymore, but there are new models you can get for $150. (Emulating is easier to record. I use OBS for that.) What ghost plush? Some of the writing is illegible, but you are right! Thanks Arch! I hardly have time to read my HW assignments, but I can consider it for a break. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Ooo! (Sorry for it being blurry.) I bought mine used so it has 5 different handwritings in it. Let me get mine. Oh sick! It's a fall themed show so make sure to watch it before December. It's similar to how nobody watches "Elf" outside of Christmas. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wc1-q1CX_E It's only 2.5 hours long total. You buy it on Amazon or Youtube easily. Or if you're on edge, the first episode is free.  To explain it's connection to Dante. The first episode reflects the first canto of The Divine Comedy. Two boys are wandering in a wood and don't know how they got there. One of the boys is an insecure poet (similar to Dante). There is also a character in the show called "Beatrice" that helps the two boys get home.  Episodes 2-10 all line up with a different layer of the Inferno. It's a short Cartoon Network show. It's a timeless masterpiece. I can't praise it enough. It's only 2 and a half hours long and it's really deep. I don't cry when watching TV, but watching Over The Garden Wall is different. If anyone knows about "Over The Garden Wall", the plot of that show was inspired by Dante. I'm doing this lecture for fun actually! I read the Divine Comedy last year for a class and am re-reading it for inspiration for a story I want to write. (Not live) I'm watching a lecture about Dante's Inferno. Oh, darn. Are you saying there isn't a friendly bokoblin outside of the Shrine of Resurrection that will trade spice for wheat!? Yah, that's where you get the wheat. Sure I did! It explains a lot of this. I made a guide for making bread. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkw2AE9eopY I already did research on a bread run months ago. The fastest way to get wheat is by getting to the Rito region. I agree. It is morally okay. ^ Not legally, but that's alright.  I use questionable means to get my emulated games. **But!** I only emulate games I own.  I do Emulation so that I can record easier. Good luck and have fun! I see. This is just confusing. Alt account? Oh. Did you get kicked? What in the? Nice story! I might not love snow, but I LOVE snow days. That is amazing.  Ha ha, that's crazy! The algorithm must be catching up slowly. It's too early! We can't snow before Halloween. 😄 Ayy, thanks Clover! I have a good feeling about today. Man overboard! We hear yah loud and clear. 😄 Ahoy Slurp! If you say so!  That's uncool. I think. 🤔 Sarcasm doesn't work on Discord. 😖 Same. Um, congrats? We're all rooting for yah Elic! GFX?  I'll never grammatically recover from this. I feel lazy and unfulfilled. 😅  Last night I did nothing but binge watch Fit MC videos about 2B2T (The Minecraft anarchy server) and now I don't have the motivation to make a video. I'm going on a hike. That should help. See yah'll in a bit! Good luck anyways! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  Those are some great camera angles! What is the video for? Oh! My bad. Thanks for explaining that.  Those are some great camera angles! What is the video for? I'm going to bed soon so I'll see yall tomorrow. I'm not sure if I'll finish a video this week. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Good luck with the HW boss!  I would reset if it took that long. 90-30? I can't see the full question. 😄 https://tenor.com/view/dog-rescue-save-me-gif-5464191 Sorry King. We don't have many bots. Just the bare necessities. Good luck with the zombie slaying! I'm going to be doing HW and then going to bed.  You can promo! That's what it's there for.   You are both demoted now. 😄 Yah, it's so sad. https://tenor.com/view/yourefired-yourfired-spongebobfired-spongebob-patrick-gif-18350896 Sorry Tax. You lost your status.  The bot deletes most swear words, so you'd need to be trying hard if you wanted to swear. I don't want the role either. I have a Youtube channel! It's called "The Bread Pirate". That is a philosophical question. I could have sworn It was in one of my pockets. https://tenor.com/view/phone-forgetful-wheres-my-phone-gif-12472135 Speaking of which, where did I leave my motivation. I don't need caffeine! I need motivation. 😄 I like food!  Thanks for the boost Elic! They aren't very articulate with their gang description either. 😄 I have been wondering that as well. Seems like they are creating a gang of people with a W in their name. Oh, yah, Roth is the name of the dorm I live in.  It's a Classic Texture pack. Not sure which one though? I think I'll be changing it soon. It's the original Sword Art Online I know the names, but I didn't grow up with them. What a strange show. I don't mind. Just be aware I won't always remember who you are if you change your username all the time. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ What's wrong with you changing that username? What is your username on Youtube? It's a Wii U emulator, thus is runs BotW. It's not an emulator designed for ONLY BotW. Since the Wii U was made. Pretty cool stuff. It's even mentioned  at 4:30 that there is a mod being used. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3wtjuQXYjU This video for instance uses a variety of mods inorder to achieve various camera angles. I don't think so. Only on a PC. I know for a fact there are other Zeltubers emulating their footage since it's the only way of getting 60FPS in BotW. I don't put that in the description of my videos cause it's not important for what I'm doing. (Unless I'm modding. Then it's a bigger deal.) Um, well... to be fair you've only been on the server a day. Yup! And on an Emulator Nice! I wish I had a 5 star rating.  I have a 0 star rating since I don't have a Switch. I'm sure you'll find it soon! Did you ever find the Animal Crossing Cartridge? Ahoy Ultra! Anything new happen since we last chatted? Nope. No idea. Alright, that was fun. Say goodbye to the Captain role Ultra. It's a game developed by Nitrome. You're already promoted! Looks like Ultra is in charge. Darn. I've been ousted. Ahoy Ultra! Staying out of trouble today? 😋 Ooo, that's unfortunate. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVe0gjYHP5U Nice! The assignments I had in English class helped me understand the book better than I would have otherwise. But it depends on the book. Hmm, never read it. What was the book? That's awful! How could someone do that. 😳  Welcome 11! In my opinion... Zelda 1 + 2 A lot of games past that include Armos/Beamos. Ocarina of Time and ALTTP are close seconds for me. 🤔 Amen! If a series can't have a consistent genre, then is it even the same series. 😄 That's a interesting analysis! I had never considered the explanation behind the science found in the movies. > Unpopular opinion: Star Wars isn't sci fi. It's fantasy set in space. Yeah I said it It's a fantasy story, with Sci-Fi technology. 😄 Hence the "Sir Luke" "Princess Leah" "Lord Vader" "Jedi Knights" and the time obiwan said "Crusade" https://media.tenor.com/images/27f307f9d8822feeea1838de619e2b98/tenor.gif I'll be patient. 😋 Way to go clover! Make sure to share it when you're done. I'd love to see that. Wow! Good luck. Sounds tedious.  What is it you are making? Godspeed! Hopefully you can learn more about it in the future. Editing is a lot of fun, and it's a good life skill. Darn. That must have been a tough bean.  Have you done any editing yourself?  Thank you! I really like how it turned out as well. (Editing wise) Ha ha, sorry 'bout that. Yah, there is a lot of Anti-Trump stuff on the internet as a whole. Twitter is the same. Politics on reddit are 100% Democratic. If you say anything remotely conservative or republican you're going to get a lot of Down-Votes. > you can display a positive opinion without getting attacked Not on Reddit! 😅 Darn. That's an expensive card! Hopefully you can find it again. For the Switch? I didn't know Gamecube controllers could be converted over! Nah, I get what you're saying. Just play with it and it'll clean itself. 😋 I love gamecube controllers! They feel so nice to play with. The nostalgia is real. What color?  That's not an efficient way of dying your hair. 😄 How's it going? Ahoy Ultra! It was busy, as per usual, but I enjoyed it. Thanks Tax! Yup! No!!! <:happy:725779401031024641> https://tenor.com/view/this-is-getting-out-of-hand-now-there-are-two-star-wars-viceroy-jedi-gif-11488909 I already have 1 brother to deal with. Now there are two! What!?  You're my brother!? o_O I am 100 - 80 years young Thank you all!  Thank you for telling everyone Coffee. 😅 Z = Sleep sounds. Which I am making. So goodnight. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Why are you posting W? https://media.tenor.com/images/492c04c29ae36ae87552eb058d21428a/tenor.gif I sleep now. Now you have videos of me! The horror! That's Private! Where'd you get that picture! I'm joking. I am just worried how you'll do it. No. 😂 Shame. 😋 Ahoy! And goodnight. pog. I'm broke. He's talking about the gif  RGNX. 😄 https://tenor.com/view/bed-time-sleepy-good-night-gif-8912066 I can send beds though! That's unfortunate! I wish you the best of luck in getting that sorted out. Sorry about that. At least we know it works now.  Whoops. I muted you for 3 minutes. I thought it was going to be 3 seconds. 😄 We have Dyno already, so we might as well use it. Oh! Interesting. Thanks for the scoop Elic.  Next In Line means you'll be next in line for the Moderator position if a position opens. Only 3 people have this role.  No, I'm interested in figuring out how to mute members what are spaming or being inappropriate. Thanks Elic! Darn. It must be a Mic only setting. Cool. I want to see what the "Mute" option does. Try texting something in chat right now. Elic, can you help me test something? Ha ha, I love it when siblings rat eachother out for being on social media at bad times. I still make fun of my brother and sister whenever they send me messages past 12. No need for a warning! Ultra is a good man. Just make sure that links to your channel and videos stay in promo, unless it's relevant to the conversation. Then it is fine to mention/share. Don't take advantage of that privilege though. I think Elic was making fun of banner makers. I don't think it was directed at you. It's alright though! We're already listed as friends Ultra. Aww, that's not funny. That's sad. 😢  Welcome aboard Ultra! > (not saying bread is poor) just saying in general  I am poor I think I'd have a hard time dating since I'm adherently a selfish person who likes the time I have to myself. I have college friends that don't understand what I mean by that. It's usually the dramatic people. 😄  That's good motto! My two mottos about dating were a little bit different though. :D "How can I date someone when I don't know who I am yet?" "I'm here for an education, not a soap opera!" (This one was my senior quote) But, now that I'm in college I'm beginning to understand who I want to be and what I am looking for in other people. I am NOT financial stable though. 😄 https://tenor.com/view/link-bop-cool-shades-legend-of-zelda-gif-11619022 Nah, I chose this life. I am a lone wolf. But I think it looks interesting. As a male who has never dated I can not say what females find liking in. Oh, I see. I found the website. https://meetcircle.com/ Does it not work well? What is Circle by Disney? Is that a song or something? 🤔 I'm looking it up. So many Flintstones references. 😄  Nice channel! I love the high quality rips/remixes they do. Oh! Well that is "good" That's how I do things. Asking questions forces people to come to conclusions themselves, thus it's not rude. Perhaps you can ask him nicely about it? Example: "Father dear, since I can't view comments, do you have an alternative way for my to respond to people on Youtube?"  Are you able to see comments on some videos? Darn The only cults I take part in are "cult classics" 😄 It's a Gerudo symbol on their cloak, but their skin is grey, like Vaati. Might be Ganondorf? Or Vaati? The ending is really cool! This one ^ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt4V5hayZ-A Outside? What is that? R in the chat. Thanks for the idea!  Thanks Tax! Spam deleted. Bubble wrap has been deleted.  I popped them all. Ahoy Tax! Can't stay to chat. I've got dinner to be eaten. Ethiopia is a fascinating country. Especially it's resistance to colonization. Ethiopia Listen, if you're just saying it cause it sounds like the N word that's not gonna fly. What about Nigeria? Has there been another Civil War or something? Sorry about that. I know it's going to exclude some people, but I really want the mods to be able to interact with people in voice chats. Heck, you're active enough. Well of course you don't know. I was asking Scarf. :D What about Nigeria? https://tenor.com/view/yuck-gross-disgust-eww-steve-carell-gif-3556274 Sounds nasty. I wouldn't want to eat it so I consider it an ow. More like a serious ow. 😄 You should feel much better then. 😄 https://tenor.com/view/smart-meme-think-about-it-gif-7906618 Calling at 8? That's pretty late.  Have you considered that the cooties are causing your sickness? Every year, 4 people die of cooties. It's labeled by the International Health Organization as the #1 killer of people who have cooties. Cooties kill people Catfish.  Cooties are a serious disease! https://tenor.com/view/castiel-dean-cooties-what-confused-gif-8297198 I'm sorry about that, hopefully this spell will help. No! Oh, I thought you asked What do you mean? I'm busy today with meetings, projects, and an RPG session with a cousin of mine. I mean that it's a good morning. 😄 Good morning! I considered a lot of names for the server before making it public, but I decided on The Bread Pirate's Server since it's the least confusing name I could think of. You have the Ban% and Member+% Welcome Lior! Happy to have you join the server! Make sure to read the rules. He got the speedrun. Banned. Maybe I could make a new color for creator? I don't know we'll see in the future. I didn't do it. 🤔 Welcome to the crew Lior! We're always glad to have new members aboard! Well. Oh.  I removed Content Creator so that you could get the pink color back. If you want it back you can have it. Nope! No, you can't lose crew member+, unless you asked to get rid of it. Later. I went because I have Lunch. That was it. That's the entire idea. It's just a role you can get for free on a holiday. 😄 Maybe we could add Holiday roles though. It was a joke guys. I'm not making that a role. 😋 I think I remember that. Sorry boss. Maybe we'll need a new role. "Post-Early Bird" Less than a year old. 🤔  I know small Youtubers who DO take part in their servers, you are right. 😅  *Kinda* is a good word to describe it. Ha ha, I can't take that much credit.  I just enjoy talking with yall.    That's all! Yes, that was a flex. And one of which I am proud of.  I don't think most Youtubers take part in their servers enough so I like being the odd ball out. I do most of the moderating myself. 😁 Ha ha, this server is small enough that our mods only have to deal with situations once a month. I know RGNX had to delete a message last month, and The Rat Pirate only has has to censor one meme. It's not a tough job unless an emergency comes up like HACKERS! or a RAID! (But I think we're safe.) Yes. But the idea is that they wouldn't abuse it to make 20 roles for themself. 😄 It's not really.  Mods on this server can delete messages, give roles, and kick, but they can't do anything drastic to the server's make up. Don't listen to Lior. 😄 He's messing with you. That's a different type of Mod. "Moderator"  Thanks for being patient with me right now. I saw your request earlier and I am still thinking about it.  The server has been lax recently so I don't think we "need" any mods right now, but I know that it's good to have mods already in place for when trouble strikes. I'll ask my manager so see what he thinks about this and we'll hopefully find a system for mod applications, or perhaps not having mods. It's all up in arms. It'll be at least a day before I get a response from him and implement a system.  Welcome aboard Thunder! I appreciate a person that can site General Grievous Memes. https://tenor.com/view/this-is-unexpected-unexpected-unforeseen-circumstances-surprise-seth-meyers-gif-9711586 o_o I have lunch though, so I'll be on my way. 👋  It's clever to relate is to the Shrine of Resurrection! Might warrant investigation.   This is a Gaming channel conversation. I'm cool with no guns. Zelda is a Medieval fantasy game. When I want a game with guns I play a different franchise. Oh, now I see the trouble. Wait, why couldn't Zelda have had the Triforce of Wisdom? We see in other games that Ganon can use the triforce of Wisdom even when it's in Zelda's possession. He just had to incapacitate her (and Zelda is incapacitate in Zelda 2). Adam = Hyrule Gamer? Now that I think about it, it's also the size I use when I order drinks. 🤔 I chose Infamous' discord cause it's small. That's my ideal setting. 😄 Ha ha, we owe a lot of ours membership to RGNX. He's the g.o.a.t. Cool, I was curious since I'm doing research about old Zelda forums and wanted to know if you had any experience. Oh! Was that your first time? So how long have you been in the Zelda community? I know you're a life long fan, but when did you first get into forums and Discords? Remind me Arch, when did you first get involved in the Zelda community? It ended up being a back and forth meme battle on reddit. 😄 There are some fun political posters for BotW Characters. Let me see if I can find some.  And that is because you don't have one yet. Once you get one then you can't look forward to it anymore. 😄 You already have that. It's not like you get to look forward to a drivers license of the ability to vote. 😦 Being older is epic until you reach 30. Then it starts getting unepic. 😅 Happy Birth Anniversary! Science is important so long as it's safe. Bye Gamer! R in the chat for E It's too late Sum. You've started a cultural revolution. This is a pirate server right? Shouldn't our letter be R? I don't know if this is a thing on just our server, or if this is a legitimate fad. Oi vey, I already have 3 analysis video in my subscription feed talking about Young Purah and Robbie. o_o They're young! Boom! That's it! No need to watch 40 minutes of people speculating. 😅 Oh, I see! That explains it much better. ^ I agree. What do you mean? The last Youtube conversation we had on this channel was about finding the oldest Zeltube video. 😄 Monthly? Weekly? We believe you RGNX. 😄 https://tenor.com/view/-gif-4145835 There are lots of ways to "try" on youtube. What have you been trying exactly? Nice pin RGNX. 😄 Whoa! That's a plot twist. **Nintendo when they see speedrunners break their games:** How can a game be so broken. I already am impressed! Didn't they figure out a way to teleport to Ganon from the Kokiri Forest? Nintendo News Round Up: Ocarina of Time Beaten in 5 Second! Speedrunners can't believe it! Really? You'd think that the need to be faster all the time would make them more stressed. It's impressive! But they must be super stressed with their job. Forget my guess of 5. That's way off. Oh! I hadn't considered speedrunners. Crap. Most Zeltubers are newer than 2010. I'm guessing there are less than 5 Zeltubers still alive since then (and that are still focusing on Zelda). Okay, one more. :D This was a timeline video made two years before the official timeline was released. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2g65jL3HDg Gosh, I need to stop going down this rabbit hole. :D I'm getting lunch and getting to work on HW. I'll see yall later! This is the guy who makes insane rom hacks for N64 games! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0svMCWbdrU My word! Look at this. It's a video from 2008 that has a comment from Kaze Emanuar! It's too bad that Youtube doesn't have an option to sort by oldest. That would help a lot. I think Game Theory was the first channel to make high quality Zelda Theories, but I'm not 100% certain. It has 365,145 views even though it looks like it was edited in Windows Movie Maker. :D Pretty interesting to see how Zeltube has evolved. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGJFM-wHUd4 I'm trying to find the Older Zelda Theory on Youtube, and I found one from 2008. Yee, I like the enthusiasm. 😄 I've never watched the movie. I just thought it was applicable to the way I reacted. Good catch! Bye Vortex! I cleaned it up for yah  Happy you could join us. 😄 Ayy, welcome Dark Scrub!  I could, but I don't think I will. If I uploaded one Minecraft video that would set the expectation for MORE minecraft videos. (Or it would tell the Zelda fans on the channel that we've given up on Zelda.) That might be an extreme stance, but I want to focus on Zelda as much as possible to stay consistent. Maybe in the future we can to Minecraft. Why do you ask? Well that's good! Otherwise you'd be blind. I should add, the **type** of videos you make will impact your ability to do school and videos at the same time. Wiimonkey here is an insane example since he does 3d Pokémon animations. I think he's been working on the same video of or at least 3 months.  On the other hand, I do analysis videos. So the only hard parts for me are scripting and footage collection. Outside of that it's easy sailing. The only way to do it is by making small amounts of progress each day (ex, 1 hour of editing a day). Well that's easy! It's part of a two step program I made up. 1. Do School Work. 2. Make Videos. 😋  But on a serious note, it can be difficult. College work comes first (obviously) so I only am able to to Youtube by sacrificing free time. Not that I mind! I love making videos so it's fun. Thanks! I likes that test. I also like running long distances though. The original name for the bot was Mee6, but it looked a bit like a ChuChu so I renamed it. The other bot was originally called Dyno, but it was renamed to Dodongo so it would be in character. Yup! The Blue Chuchu sees to that. We have a blacklist on quite a few swear words. Thanks! Alright. I think this is the last time I'm changing my Halloween avatar. I had a hard time deciding the colors. Nice word! I didn't know what repudiate meant until now. Thank Archmdc. He was the one who suggested the change, and rightly so. That isn't that much text is it? 😋 Ayy thinks! But it's the same shape! 😁 It's not perfect, but it's mine. After much deliberation I think I found the Halloween Profile Picture I want. To be fair, so do Game-and-Watch's animations. 😄 According to Nintendo, yes.  Smash will never be the same again. Soon enough we'll have Smash Bros building servers. 😄 Way to enforce order. 😄 That's right Lior! Link got a nut. BotW already has Sci-Fi I'll make sure to correct that now. 😋 https://i.gifer.com/44Di.gif It's such an opinionated topic I don't know if I can do it justice. I just made the script for an episode titled, "Should Zelda have Si-Fi" and I am scared to make it. 😅 Is it a distraction if I intended to read Discord messages anyways? I'm reading so I'm already distracted. 😄 I'll have some <:Octo:735201277973364808> Well, poop. It keeps turning into an emote. I use many emojis.  Get ready for this. . .  o_o It's so nice to meet your clone. Wow, welcome RGNX! To each their own. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ And thanks for the comments.  Ayy! I didn't know that. Welcome Toto! <:Spam:732992447642206290> belongs in <:Spam:732992447642206290> Huh, poor innocent. Lots joined unfortunately for you. I have Halflife but I'm still working on playing it.  I get distracted with Zelda videos too often. 😁 Nice quote name!  Welcome aboard Cheese! https://tenor.com/view/miracle-max-princess-bride-mostly-dead-all-dead-oygente-gif-12754873 I got better. Fun! [~The Bread Pirate jumped ship!~] It was me. Muh ha ha! <:Get:738511046381142027> I wish I had learned to swim. . . Bloop bloop bloop. . . Gurgle gurgle gurgle. . . Darn. Now I'm shark food. Sorry Elic. Your ship is actually a boat. And that boat is a row boat. Thanks for joining the crew.  Ayy, welcome aboard Ben! Agreed! I don't think his name is Octavian? Octavian is good octopus. Octavian is my favorite character from Applewood. At least that's what one guide said. There are guides to getting villagers to leave I think. But once you get to 6 you can't go lower. More options is always a good thing.  Nintendo games aren't very good at that though. Darn. Then you'd need to kick out villagers, and that's heart breaking. Really! That's fantastic for laying out an archipelago.  Oh,wait, 2? That's still good. What's the minimum amount of villagers you can have? It's not often people travel backwards is it? Ha ha, that's awesome. At least you have one. 😄 I was too busy with college to talk about college. 😖 https://tenor.com/view/anakin-star-wars-padme-gif-5048790 Drat. I don't like sand anymore. I don't think beaches can be terraformed though, so that's a problem. I'm watching an Animal Crossing video right now and it makes me want to get the game. :D Of course, I need a Switch first. My island would be made up of many smaller island each with a different house/purpose. And then there would be bridges connecting them all. A lot of school happens to be that way... And it sucks. 🤮 Ahoy King! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Then I'll upload it again.  Take your time boss! The video wont be going anywhere. The server is small enough that we can manage. 😖 Thanks for the offer, but we aren't looking for mods at the moment. We will see. . . 🤔 It's too powerful! o_o Ha, RGNX as the captain? Fat chance. (No offense Random) So long as there isn't a mutiny I be the captain of this server. In this case it was given by The Captain "(For especially active members of the community. Given at Moderator's discretion.)" English = English Well, on second thought, that's incorrect. British = British Have fun!  IZ has got some nice videos to explore.  Ayy! Welcome aboard boss! <:happy:725779401031024641>  @.everyone- Infamous is another Zeltuber who makes theories, top 10's, and analysis videos about Zelda. He's well worth checking out.  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVkZTy0T8xfXiXhVo924Sng You betcha! Put it in Pictures and Videos. Sure! It's a hot button issue to say the least! I only hope I did the topic justice considering how controversial it is. Thanks for the vote of confidence. It has my attention as well! Its a topic I'm passionate about so I love being able to share it with others. (Fixing Shrines perhaps. . . ? 😋) Not yet! That project is going to be a tough one. 😖  I'm working on a Collab with Infamous Zelda first, then I'll get started on the compare/contrast. I think I'm finished with the thumbnail too. In other news, there should be a new video coming out tomorrow. https://tenor.com/view/easy-button-that-was-easy-red-button-press-the-button-gif-17005111 Probably not done yet. Ah ha! Bread ripe for the plundering! Piracy is a tough job. 😄 And if you don't then you'll have to walk the plank. 😄 Sum is from another Zeltuber Discord. He's a great guy. Ayy! Welcome Sum! Myself included. 😋 Ha ha, yah. I consider all Zelda Youtubers "Zeltubers" @.everyone  Jo's a guest from another Zeltube server. He's a great guy. Ahoy boss! I love it! To bad the words are covered in that mode. I think it works better in different places. Oooo! Oh, umm... not sure where that's found. It doesn't show for me. But if it works for you then good! https://discord.gg/MbwrRhy Oh sweet! I don't know where it's suppose to show up on the server, but it IS activated. I posted it in announcements just now. He won the banner contest. Starting at 2. I forgot to add a time to the announcement. Me too! Now I have time to do more Homework. 😄 Timezones are the bane of my existence. We should either make all time the same, or move all of humanity into a single timezone. That's still good progress! That's a lot of words. That would do it. 🤮 Viv is in a lot of my doodles. <:Vivi:723571545116508220> Yes I doodle sometimes... 😄 These were my notes for a class on Frankenstein. (Turns out it has a lot of cultural significance) Hopefully that helps.  You'll need to experiment to figure out what works for you. Especially if you go into college. I would summarize this by saying...  **"Communism doesn't like religion."** Definitely! You might even want to read through the entire thing before taking notes so that you have the big picture about what's important. Here's an excerpt from one of my class presentations about communism and religion... *"Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo."* I often will have professors show an entire paragraph in a powerpoint during class, so I just have to write a 5 word summary of the paragraph and move on. Yah. That's how I do it when reading AND in class. I suppose the speed of your reading matters too. 😄 Ah! I loved US History! If it's an AP or college level class then you'll definitely need to be diligent with your note taking, but you don't need to write EVERYTHING. When I write notes for a section of a book I try to fit all my information on a single index card. It's not suppose to tell me everything about the reading, but it really helps jog my memory. I can show you the way I do notes if you want. I can do them pretty fast. High School right? And grade? What part of history is this? Spooky. Poor dude. Hopefully he'll get a revive soon. Except it's the wrong console. 😄 Me driving at 8 https://tenor.com/view/mario-kart-race-luigi-mario-yoshi-gif-3581050 Good on them. <:happy:725779401031024641> Same as NY 14 year olds can drive in S Dakota? Neat. I said illegally though. Illegally! Heck yah! Now you can drive! Perhaps the word "waste" was a bit strong. 😄 Oh, no. I meant like if 0 people see it. If we can get a few people too see it at least then we have a case for quality. It's not often that quality is ignored, but I would argue that your efforts are wasted if you make quality and no one sees what you have made. (Unless you make videos because you think the process is fun. That's an entirely different story.) Does quality matter, if no one sees it?  Here! Have some... <:sub:725422469027987507> Huh. The more you know. Whew! That's some spicy progress. It's one of the few non pixel emotes we added. I'd get rid of it, but I know that there'd be a mutiny. It's Windwaker Link looking closely into the camera. Whew! That makes me feel better. :O I hope his friend makes it out of this alright! Chuggaconroy also was a big inspiration for me growing up. I won't have become a letsplayer without him. I used to watch a lot of his stuff. Especially some of his older videos. PBG is an inspiration. https://tenor.com/view/genie-tell-her-the-truth-gif-9568719 Nah, the truth is usually the right decision. I told them the truth. I haven't gotten a response yet though.  The person that I got DM'ed by (for lying to them about the mods I made) is the same person who made those hacking mods for Peanut Butter Gamer. Yup I'm chillin in voice chat for a while while I ponder life and Zelda.  Happy to have you existing with us! We should change that. We haven't played A Link to the Past in a while. Tis life. No thanks. I'll go to sleep though. Why would we join something that will crash our PC? Same It's nice to see you find your way here. 😄 Ayy! Welcome aboard Tom! Well, technically this is a Zelda server. My username just happens to be about pirates. Ayy! That's fine. Thanks for stopping by! It's been nice meeting you. Power too yah then! :D I like the Bird-With-Arm profile picture. What's up with Taxes and Discord? Am I missing something! 🤔 I'd call yah Tax, but I think The Tax Pirate has yah beat. Welcome Collector! Huh, you too? Tax was having that issue. It went away eventually though. God is good. 👼 Start looking forward to a march release. Nah, I'm kidding. Elic just did it. Always has been. And i like pixelated ones. Zelda themed are best. Sure, but I can't guarentee they'll be added. The fish is an exception. That was for the fishing episode. :D   Thanks again guys! My skills are meh. 😄 I only make the pixel emotes and polish up Zelda spirites. <:Drink:742212331228102657> <:Octo:735201277973364808> <:mad:730068988301803530> <:Heart:742212343114629170> <:Chu:723608915677413467> <:Get:738511046381142027> I don't think i have time to add a ton of more emotes, but a banner doesn't sound that bad. Well, I guess we have to give yall both credit then. Wait, so ivan and Elic boosted? Oh, whoops. Wrong person. Thanks Elic! I don't know how to wield this power. What does this mean? The voice actor confirmed it. ‘So long kinga Bowser!’ So it's not inappropriate despite what the internet says. ‘Important question, @CharlesMartinet,’ one Twitter user wrote. ‘Does Mario say “So long, Bowser!” or “So long, King Bowser!” in Super Mario 64 when he throws Bowser?’ Martinet simply responded: ‘So long kinga Bowser!’ Nvm, Ill take this to the Zelda chat. 😄 Oh! That is something I did not realize was possible. Hopefully not. I like to keep those lil' historical things accurate. It's nice that they're higher resolution as well. It's just a matter of price vs enjoyment. All the games are classics, so it's hard to say it's a bad game.  Me too.  Age of Calamity Time to get the whole school to subscribe. Nice. Your channel's international. From what I've heard, it is level based. So overworld exploration might not be included.  It would be interesting if it did, but I don't know enough about the Warriors series to say what will happen. Its a tough decision. "It's Raining Somewhere Else" is a close second. Ruins is my favorite Undertale song right now. I love Undertale Music! The classics. <:Get:738511046381142027> This is one of my go-to videos right now: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsnRhRvBpzk Meanwhile I've been listening to a lot of 30's songs. 😄 I'm listening to it right now. This is some weird stuff. My school doesn't have a Discord, but my building does. That's cool. <:happy:725779401031024641> Nope. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsJc2ZhbXIg I'm so proud of you. 😄 You Rick Rolled someone! I have to get to sleep. I'll see yah maties tomorrow! Better get on that. 😉 Terraria gets crazy at the end game. https://tenor.com/view/terraria-gif-5697283 Wait until you start shooting rainbows from your sword and riding a unicorn for speed. Have fun! It's long but rewarding game. Terraria is the bomb! Just write the word essay. It's only 3 more letters. Pfft... that's an awful abbreviation. 😄 Silly Ant-eater Stubborn Ant  ? What is SA Idunno. Tax said it though. I made a South America South America SA? Here's what I did so people didn't think I was depressed. It's a really easy life hack, and a lot of people don't use it. Say Good Morning/Afternoon to people all the time.  Starting from when I was in 3rd grade I would say Good Morning/Afternoon to every single teacher I had, and I eventually started saying it to all my friends in the hallway until I got comfortable saying it to strangers (such as I do everyday in college). It helps people see me as optimistic. Hmm, well that does put a damper on things. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ That might just be a personality you have.  I like keeping with a small group of friends as well. Nope. Middle School is a time with a lot of opportunity for learning. Even if it is tough socially. At least you can start now, right? > and then i try to edit the english version of the word to spanish I admire your ability to translate it. I have a hard time remembering names and new languages. I'm good! But I'm going to bed soon. Really? Well that stinks. I didn't know you were at least. 🤔 Wait a minute, no you aren't! That explains a lot. 😄 You'll be safe then. We should teach all people how to be left handed then. "You’re probably safe In most cases, neck cracking is completely harmless. The sound you hear is most likely due to tiny gas bubbles that form and pop in the fluid between your synovial joints. This process, as far as we know, causes no damage to your neck. While cracking the neck has not been extensively studied, we know from medical literature on cracking fingers that this habit does not increase the risk for arthritis. There is currently no evidence that suggests neck cracking leads to arthritis." I'm doing research about this now to double check myself, and the internet agrees that Neck cracking is alright. Weird. Cracking joints means that your joints are rubbing up against each other (I believe). So it's not bad in the short-term. In the long term it can cause problems I think. No Good bye General! Temporary until the series ends. Speaking of Fire Emblem, you have a live streaming series for that right now right? I like making my army of Dittos beat up other pokemon. It just happened due to covid. That is correct. Yup Age of Calamity is a bunch of Right Wing rhetoric! Oh wait, NVM, we're done with politics. 😄 Ha ha, see yah later then Orange. Nah, I watch the BBC. They're honest about American news. BOTH are happening! Unfortunately, Left Wing news only covers the protests, and Right Wing news only covers the riots. Protest=Good Riot=Bad https://tenor.com/view/spiderman-responsibility-gif-4589950 Sure! Not that either system is perfect. Both have adherent flaws. Whew! That's a hefty law. Huh. The more you know. Really? In Canada? An example: "European Court of Human Rights has made it clear that the denial or revision of 'clearly established historical facts – such as the Holocaust – [...] would be removed from the protection of Article 10 by Article 17' of the ECHR" In Philosophy Club we discussed how American Free-Speech differs from most Western Countries.  In some Western Countries they adopt a "Mostly Free Speech" where certain things are outlawed if they attack a person's Civil Rights. That is the most American thing I have ever heard on this server. 😄 But free speech is also what empowers Neo-Nazis and Racists to use slurs and derogatory language. Where do we draw the line between healthy and harmful free speech? > I have bsa today  Nice! I was just in a Philosophy Club meeting yesterday and we discussed something similar in regards to free-speech. Bro I believe that is an acceptable reaction. But I am also not LGBTQ My logic is this... Just because I don't support people drinking Coffee (cause it's an addiction) doesn't mean I hate them. 😅 They can keep drinking coffee if they want, but I aint having none of that. Amen Yoshi. 😄 Just like everyone else. Still, they deserve to be treated with the upmost human respect. We used to have the Deep Conversation channel for this stuff, but you can discuss it here if you want. My stance is that an LGBTQ person can do whatever they want. But I do not agree with the decision. Oh boy, where do I start. First off, I'm only speaking for the USA, I don't know Europe. But Americans often over-estimate the amount of LGBTQ people in the country.  The closest answer is realistically around 4.5% of adults (5.1% of women and 3.9% of men). But some surveys think it is even lower at about the 0.6% range. Where did you find that statistic. 😅 Is it slavic? I don't even understand what it's saying. Oh snap. He pulled the "Buddy" card Gosh. That's weird. Your analytics must be a rollercoaster. Congrats on 80. 😄 Goodnight! https://tenor.com/view/mind-blown-explosion-mente-explota-gif-7721542 That's almost as bad as a Ditto army! https://tenor.com/view/this-is-getting-out-of-hand-now-there-are-two-star-wars-viceroy-jedi-gif-11488909 I'll let yah know. 😋 Or maybe before that? Not sure. Sure! I'll be available after playing Sea of Thieves with my brother for a bit. I don't think alot of people check the descriptions of videos, so I like to add rewards for the people that do. You can see that in the description of the video where I listed all the songs (and added a few easter eggs.) I had that Cave theme in my Compare/Contrast. 😄 I love the variety that Twilight Princess did with it's caves. But it didn't have very many of them. Caves, Grottos, Temples, Mines, Dungeons, underwater lakes... all of it. Those are my big three. Adding Caves, Removing Durability, and making Item Based Progression. Me too! Breath of the Wild will be a tough game for Nintendo to surpass in quality. But I hope the sequel can combine traditional zelda elements and BotW elements to make something even better. Take that Breath of the Wild! A game can't be "Perfect" unless it is free technically. Ideal = Free $30 on a sale $40 on a normal day. But the game isn't very cheap. 😖 It's a blast! Minus the VR. Kind of like a VR chat for pirates. It's a free form pirate simulator. They still put references to older games in it. Rare lives on. 😄 Technically, it IS made by Rare. His PC finally works! I'm doing great! I was just playing Sea of Thieves with my brother. He's a philosopher. It's super important! But not fun unless you think about it as a puzzle. The title of the paper is ridiculous as well. :D I love adding in little gags like that. To be fair, his paper was awful. 😄   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy4-OMUkxIQ <:mad:730068988301803530> Done I have to get dinner so I'll be away for a bit! Godspeed Yoshi. I agree. No game is perfect. BotW especially could have used a lot of upgrades, which I hope the sequel has. I haven't heard about this yet. I'll have to read the article. Who knows. The internet is unpredictable. This is why I'm a gameplay analysis and NOT a speculator. Man, I don't know anymore. Zelda titles are usually named after an item/person in the game, but BotW tossed that tradition out the window.  There isn't a single Zelda game that is named after it's predecessor, so it seems unlikely from that perspective. Yet, Nintendo might want to use the same name as BotW so that it is easier for people to tell what kind of game it is.  That's not a bad idea! I'm not sure if it'll work or not though. 😄 I've experience this "hype viewership" on my videos in the past when BotW was first announced as "Zelda U" Oh yes! Or... at least it's possible.  If Nintendo announces the title of the game as something different than BotW, then probably not. All of my videos use that title so they'd become obsolete. But if I make a video after the announcement of the sequel and use the correct title then that video should be much more successful simply because of the hype. So it's possible this video will stop getting views at 200 and stay there for a year. Depends on the way you look at things. Typically, a video does its best in the first few days. After that it slows down in views (unless a big event happens, like Nintendo announcing a new game). It's not half bad.  I wish there were more comments, but that's normal. 😄 How did that happen? Usually you're right there telling them what you want. Good eye. :D You guys already gave it a few extra views. According to my analytics we're only at 13 views as of publishing. 38 over the course of last-night and today. 😇 The video's public now! Lets hope it does alright. Ahoy! Night Cowboy! I'm not sure what setting needs to be changed to remove everyone pinging while allowing me to do it in Announcements, but I'll figure it out tomorrow. Alrighty! Thanks for letting me know. Warning removed! How about this, if you use the @.everyone again I'll pardon your Warning just so that was can test this. 😄 Ooo, that sucks. DaVinci doesn't usually crash, but I had so many elements on the timeline it couldn't handle it. Long weekends sound worth it to me.  I'm awake, but I'm getting ready for classes so I can't talk. Ayy! He self promos. Nice. I ended up talking with him earlier which was fun.  How did you find Legend Zone? OH! I see. It's still a gif, but now it has PNG assets to it. Wait, PNG? Wow... I didn't know you did animation. Or is that modeling?  Did you make that Gif! Probably nothing. Babies just cry, right? I'm almost at a month too, but minus a week. 😢   I had to change the size of the tracks using the settings to the top left of the timeline. Late reply, but your question depends on what you consider generic? If you mean music which sounds similar to everyone else's, then yes. But that's because all music in a genre sounds similar to an extent. That's not on you. I think it sounds really decent, especially considering how young of a creator you are. With a bit of time to hone your skills you could easily make Leonardo DaVinci levels of art (just in music)! 😁 Oh! Double lucky! Oh, snap. You'll be able to have a relaxing evening then. I have a meeting at 4, but how did School go? Ahoy! Eww... that's unfortunate. https://tenor.com/view/when-you-have-to-go-to-school-bed-time-gif-10731612 Just use a different word for the a Sure Make them in spanish! That'll be fun. Gotta have those Birthing Day memes. Better get started on those memes then. I'm going to class. I'll look forward to memes when I get back. HAPPY BIRTHING DAY! It's gonna have playable champions and Zelda. And it's gonna tell us more about Pre-Calamity Hyrule. A) It's a prequel B) No, this is not BotW2 C) More updates coming on Sept 26th https://tenor.com/view/dance-black-man-hype-gif-12217253 I'm probably not getting the new Hyrule Warriors game, but I'm definitely going to watch it.  Good morning! And welcome aboard Green House. I'll be staying awake all night of course... (Yawn) ...but I might be too busy to respond in chat. Goodnight! > ill get a better capture device one day Those are pretty expensive so good luck! I myself have managed only a month. But I wasn't trying very hard. > Ok, well I guess you are the pirate, so I can’t tell you more about the pirate’s way of life. Aye. Black Beard himself managed to stay awake for 3 months while chasing a gold transport of the Spanish Main! > 2/5ths of the way to 50 subs i guess You'll get there one of these days! 50 subs is a good goal for a new creator. (Yawn) Yarg! Pirates don't need wisdom, they need plunder! I refuse! Sleep is... *(yawn)* ...for the weak! *Edited because I am tired.* We are safe from getting our roles stolen! "Do ask for this role! It features no perks, but it has a pretty color. You need to get to 50 Subscribers to qualify and need to show effort. Contact The Captain to learn more." Revised to be more suitable for our server. > In that case I may be in trouble, because I don't make monthly animations. .-. You're cool. In fact, I might not fit the criteria if I don't finish my video soon. <:Chu:723608915677413467>  I'll change the description. Too bad they didn't really bomb it. But I relent. Need is a strong word. 😄 https://tenor.com/view/kuill-the-mandalorian-i-have-spoken-nod-gif-15568954 This is the way. https://tenor.com/view/nope-sponge-bob-icant-gif-6905756 Hmm... let me think about that. But the Matrix is **not **reality and it fits that criteria! "What is real? How do you define real? If you're talking about what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then real is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain." This clip is when he starts considering the make-up or reality. The Matrix is deep. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVro5wxqh4U Mitsuki is fictional, and thankfully you are not. 😄 You must not be a hardcore Mario Kart player then. I use brakes a lot on Rainbow Road I don't think Mario Kart characters use Seatbelts. https://tenor.com/view/mario-kart-banana-mario-funny-gif-13925565 It's super scary! Especially when you think about the amount of times I've crashed in Mario Kart. That's odd. It's not often you hear someone called a "good driver". Usually you're a driver or your a bad driver. If only vehicles still had cannons on them. Then we could 💥  them off the road. 🏴‍☠️ Driving stresses me out because it involves ME driving a $11,990 machine around a bunch of things that can destroy it. I have a lot of HW again, but I'm well! Philosophy Club is starting again on campus. I would be really boring if I had Nitro. I'd just use my <:Heart:742212343114629170> emote more often on other servers. Wrong channel, but I like it.  I stream in the #Game Chat 1  I won't be streaming until my latest video is done though. By Jove!  I just learned that S.S. technically stand for Steam Ship! S.V. stands for Sailing Vessel!  I'll change that right away. Welcome aboard Coffee!  (Stand for Sailor Ship) > Youtube Link That one is a classic!  There are a lot of fan made BotW animations which might interest you then. I've seen quite a few. https://tenor.com/view/staples-easy-button-that-was-easy-easy-gif-12841577 That was easy. Ayy! Congrats! **PURPLE ROLE**         <:Get:738511046381142027> <:Get:738511046381142027> <:Octo:735201277973364808> I should probably update the Get emote so that it has a blacker outline, but it fits. Root Soda Soda Yes since it's progress. I still have 12 other minutes to do, but it's better than nothing. > Alright.  Trying to motivate myself to do homework. Would it help if I said, "You can't do it!" as a form of reverse psychology? > How are you  I'm doing well! I have about 3 minutes done on the video. Ahoy! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNnlFw29q4 I like Paper Mario 64's Music as well. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eBXoDF1BBc I like this one from it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ4kbzxKyNo&list=PLz23nO6Hjlf8RmYONrZZEsAIhb4hDuiM4&index=1 I should really play that one. From the Wii? Me neither! 😄 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBsqRDeoTtw&list=PLtvzunaZYC062Rawimf8wGpf44nT5Bamb&index=4 Technically, Delfino Plaza (from Super Mario Sunshine) is Gypsy Jazz. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kw1KKA8mg Very. Contrariwise, I've been listening to a lot of Gypsy Jazz while I play games. This is one of my favorites, but usually Synthwave has more dubstep elements too it (which I could care less about). Synthwave Video Game music is champ. It covers a lot of genres though. Similar to the "strangers things" intro. It's a retro 80's inspired space music. Type I recently discovered Synthwave music. It's really nice. I saw that this morning too! It's absolutely bonkers! You're the only purple person now! Congrats. 😄 I'm gonna be doing HW. 😦 > also  when u join server it still says u can get notification squad  Thanks for the warning! I'm on it. I'm doing great! I can't wait for this weekend. I'll probably go on a hike. Yo Thanks! I think in this situation you were looking for a literal butt. And not the grammatical type. 😄 *butt Yup. This December will be my 10th year. It took me 9 years to pull that off. You're well on your way to overcoming PewDiePie. 😁 Whoop whoop! Congrats! Free and Flexible, but eats up a lot of Ram/CPU Davinci Resolve 16 It's super "play of the game" CURSES NINTENDO! Lets hope not. No Announcement. It was just uploaded to youtube. Yup. It's weird, but Mario games feel very surface level while Zelda games feel deeper. (The one exception being Mario Galaxy for me.) > confession: im a bigger mario fan than zelda Heresy. Throw him in the brig! 😄 I use it so I can play Wii games. 😄 What? How does someone lose all of them. Crap. But that's what the Direct makes it look like. Not only that, but it looks like when you buy each of the game individually on the E-Shop they don't have higher resolution. It only gets the resolution boost if it's 3d All Stars. That's what it makes it sound like in the Direct. No, I think both versions are limited edition. Mario 3d All-Stars is awesome, but I don't see why it needs to be limited time. The Mario Kart remote toys surprised me quite a bit. It's a novel idea. COMMIES! Commies. Time to write a strongly worded letter to Nintendo. WHY THE HECK WASN"T THIS LIVE STREAMED! What warning? >  how did I git my minor warning? It was from a while ago, so I am unsure. I know that mods can also give out warnings though. Confusing sure, but if I told him he couldn't then I'd be lying. (Half lying) Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You cussed. Prepare to be banned! > Can I cuss here? Yes, but it will result in the ban hammer being summoned by Thor himself to smite thee out of existence. Finally! Let's hope we get it this time. A lot of words are black listed thankfully. The word "Hell" is not though because it holds legitimate conversational value in religious conversation. Otherwise, the word is discouraged. Heck is encouraged even! I'm sure I will, I'm just frustrated with the class format. It's unnecessarily complex. Interesting can also be tedious. 😖 Just had my first day of classes this semester. It's gonna be interesting to say the least. Ahoy! Well, if they banned you on Croton's Server, then we probably ought to ban you hear as well. *Elic#5743 has been banned by sever host.* Sorry it had to come to this Elic. 😋 Huh, that's very odd. What would you have done to manage that? Possible? Asynchronous communication is weird. But you'll look cool doing it! Sketchy AND Deadly! That's awesome. Running can be fun. 😄 I'll use that Moola for my PC, thanks. MeaT Ball I'm the same way!  I find a lot of inspiration to make video in other creators and my friends who appreciate my work. It's helpful to take things in chunks. And then to take those things in chunks. Yah, each shot can be a tough task depending on the shots you need. I think this video will be mildly difficult in that regard. I love long videos too, but usually that's when I'm watching them. :D On the bright side, I love editing. So this'll be fun. It's just the footage collection which takes ages. Me when I see the video length: A bit much for me. I finished recording audio for my video. Looks like it's gonna be about 16 minutes long. Ahoy! Aloha But in the future? Maybe this could help you make it rain. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvCEF5-7hwQ Rain is pretty and relaxing. It was a lot of fun, but it was also a lot of work so I'm glad I can focus on learning now. One class was about Role Playing The other was a Minecraft class where the lesson changed depending on the day. (Ex. One week was all about Medieval Life, and another week was about how to build better in Minecraft) Yup! I only taught for the summer. A better way to think of it is that I was a, "Camp Councilor" I did teach the kids things, but the focus was mostly on having fun. That's a warranted reaction. I have also met teacher who were not very skilled in teaching. But I didn't hate them. It just depends on the way you value the word "Hate" I rank it as a very harsh word, so I hesitate to use it. It also is defined as the opposite of "Love" which means it must be evil. Hate is a strong word. 😖 You just got dunked on. 😄 I'll have to get started on recording later. I have done it! The script is complete. (And it only took me 7 1/2 pages to write.) Numbers are just numbers. It is the quality of the community that matters. It doesn't help that I've been stalling on making videos. :D I ought to make something small to tide the channel over.  Welcome! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ > shouldnt this be in memes? It should be, but I'm alright with it. Don't know if they really "own" the name, but it is a thing. Baxter International uses BAX to abbreviate their name in the stock market. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BAX/ It's also copyrighted by some company. It was a typo I made one day while playing Terraria. I was in the middle of reading The Princess Bride at the time and wanted to name my character "The Dread Pirate Roberts" after one of the characters, but I accidentally typed a B. I thought it was a fantastic username so I made a new email that same day and started my Live Action channel soon after. I know. I had to squint for a second to see the difference. 😋 It's nice. No classes yet. I have this week to work on videos though. Very blurry, but cool. Cause that's the way I want to live my life! https://tenor.com/view/how-did-this-happen-bill-wurtz-planet-earth-gif-15407593 "Ayyy....!" - Bill Wurtz Speaking of subs, I'm going to lunch now. See yall in a few minutes. As a shiny collector I object your object.   😄 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YAQpaPimkM Too bad it's not a shiny. Guess we'll have to kill it. Nonsense is a great way to escape reality. > mental illness is neglected very often That is true as well. And it's something we should take into consideration. Philosophy helps in keeping citizens civil, but like we already said, people don't like thinking. https://tenor.com/view/angry-mob-riot-torches-pitchforks-gif-5859895 Let's riot. That sucks now that I think about it. Elementary School morals aren't enough for an adult citizen. Weirdly American Schools don't have many "Civic's Classes." We learn about the government/laws, but not about how to be a good citizen. That might explain some of the issues we have as a country.  Europe? Mandarin is technically what the standard Chinese Language is called. That's because there are many versions of "Chinese" My vacation starts around May, but then there is a month more of classes for students interested. Thinking is hard anyways. No, I mean that summer vacation will start 2 weeks sooner, right?  That means you'll probably end school sooner right? 1 Week. Right now my campus has student but no classes until Monday. It's hard to see, but too see, but it IS there. https://tenor.com/view/gosh-look-at-the-time-gotta-go-g2g-escape-gif-9395184 It wasn't very long, but we beat Zelda 1! I can't believe that gif exists. It's perfect for this moment. Oh no! Thanks! It's actually from a graphical glitch from Scarf Pirate Then my evil twin will be The Starve Pirate What is the opposite of bread? That's understandable. Texting is a real challenge. I know what mine is. 😄 Much better! What brand? Ooo. That's a good one. I'm working on a new intro as we speak! It's going pretty smooth. Ayy thanks! Already finished now that you mention it. I'm working on a vlog about it on my Live Action Channel. It's a meeting room I use for when I don't want lots of people joining. I haven't used it yet though. 😖 Youch. Hopefully you can master the art. Oh cheese! Why'd you have to go and do that. 😅 We're all about consistent lore here at Bread HQ. 😋 A Link to the Past is a Medieval inspired fantasy game so it exists. He isn't wrong. >  your bot is broke The bot fixed itself. They're evolving. A great way of growing ANY Discord is by having content surrounding it. A Youtube channel is a prime way of doing that. Always! Hmm... In that case, you should let them remain as a Moderator unless they do something which goes against the spirit of the server. Or, Better yet, just talk to them in a voicechat and express your concerns. That's a really interesting proposition. > yea ig Huh, neat. Not sure how I feel about that, but I can see it working for certain servers. So you elect moderators? Ooo! Congrats! I'm not a master at these things, but I'll send you a Direct Message. Godspeed! That's a shame he left...  I agree! The towns in Zelda II looks nice. And goodnight. Ahoy! This is a picture of the Zelda 2 town. Here's my current build. It's a town inspired by Zelda 2 and the 5x5 Minecraft Building System used by AndyisYoda Funny enough, I know a lot of people who play Minecraft just so they can make grinders and automated farms.  They don't even build that much, they just like making grinders. Survival is a blast. I have a semi-private server I typically play on, but thanks for the offer! People are a great outlet for talking. 😄 I gotta start a podcast or something. There's no way I can keep up with my list. > Of fixing botw Indeed. I will add it to my list. Twilight Princess > BotW (All because of the puppers) Puppers is best puppy. Wow! What a great puppy. 😄 Is Super Man a UFO? People always seem to confuse him with a bird and a plane. We are inside of the plane after all. Or did the plane eat us? Are butterflies a type of dragon? Or are dragons a type of plane? Oh, interesting analysis! Lawnmowers are a form of grass genocide. I'm not doing anything too crazy today. But I'm gonna be busy packing for college. Goodmorning! Adios! But where is he looking? Such a good letter! That's a fat car. Looks sturdy too. That's a great attitude! This is my year long Subscriber graph. It automatically comes up for me. My Sub counter is pretty wacky. That could be interesting to see. Do you know how to get to the Youtube Analytics? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Must be robots. I'm sorry, but your reality is just a part of the Matrix. That's wacky. For instance, my "Relics of the Past" video got big since other Youtubers made similar videos on the same mods. No problem! In my experience, a spike in views/subscribers means that someone made a similar video to yours... OR it means that someone gave your channel a shoutout. You definitely deserve it. You're making some nice stuff. Hey! Congratulations!  Spam goes in the Spam chat. Hence the name. Too bad there aren't difficulty modes. Congrats! Especially for a lake right? That's a big fish!  That's one of my favorite parts too! 😋 I have a long one. 😄 I'll need to add it to my To-Do List. That's a good idea! But not only that, I think rewards need an overhaul. BotW relies heavily on Statistical Upgrades (Ex. The Number of Hearts You Have, The Damage of Your Sword, The Defense of Armor, The Length of Your Stamina Bar) but not enough on Mechanical Upgrades (Giving the Player New Abilities). Sorry, I don't think I understand the question? And the Shrines. I was just thinking about how in BotW everything is so predicable. I think that kind of hurts the game. "Repetition Destroys Exploration." It's a Zelda concept I feel deserves an episode someday. Any thoughts? Thanks Ron! Nah, it's just that english is weird. Maybe I should specify my age/grade somewhere. 😄 Ageing or aging is the process of becoming older. That's good! That means I'm aging well. Highschool = Yes College = No https://tenor.com/view/well-yes-but-actually-no-well-yes-no-yes-yes-no-gif-13736934 Out of curiosity, what grade DID you think I was in? 🤔 You betcha! I'm a sophomore this year. Welp, college is starting soon for me. I guess that means we're not going to be doing any Youtube streams for a short while. Realistically it should be at 40 or something. **Mildly Interesting:** The stream from today had one of our highest Hourly View Counts since the stream had to be reset. Sorry, the stream ended up being WAY shorter than expected since we got the Master Sword so soon. > i prob wont be able to come to the stream tis time Sorry about that! Hopefully we can have schedules aline next time.  I'm sorry to hear about that. Not well. I'm doing well! > No do you?  You know it! That and flag designs for my Pirate Ship. Impressive. But do you have any history memes? Funny how that works. Yet we hear him. 🤔 I'm happy to know we're your prime time server. 😄 What's the MHA server? > I got exiled from the Croton Community :( I can understand wanting to be heard. It's especially hard to do in larger communities such as Croton's or NBC's Servers. That's why I love small communities so much. <:happy:725779401031024641> Next time try to keep your Ping Pong battle in spam. I have a class now. Godspeed maties. Yall should do this in spam. 😄 Whew, that's good. These dopplegangers have me worried about a mutiney. <:mad:730068988301803530> It's a punishment. By impersonating the captain. "Professional" usually means that you're making money off of it. That'll be tough. Oh boy, I was thinking you had an Xbox Controller you could use. Someday. Clever. Shame. Goodbye Fornite.  I got you a new role. I hope you like it. <:oldman:725422163242385518> > Lets Gooo i got a link to the past  Uh oh! Don't spoil too much for me. 😄 Have fun! > i made a twitch account  Going to be streaming soon? BABY STREAM STARTING That's good! That's too much! I'd go crazy with that many notifications. Sounds enlightening. That's a solid game plan.  What kind of stuff are you going to be making? Vlogs, Let's Plays, Tutorials? Godspeed! And don't worry about making mistakes.  A mediocre video is better than not making a video in the first place. If you keep up Youtubing for long enough you'll eventually be proud of your work. Just be patient and keep finding ways to improve. It's still messy in my eyes. You should aspire to more than my Live Action Channel. I know that. 😋  But I wasn't. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ2gvOTa8i0oFPQjPVQ0oAg Depends on the channel you're talking about. 😄 I know that too. For a long time I uploaded videos inconsistently and it bugged me. Good luck boss! I can probably speed through the beginning and catch up. :P Just disregard my schedule. I'll make sure to stop by at least once. 😁 My schedule changes from week to week so it's hard to say.  This week I have a break from 2-4, but next week I have a break from 11-3. Oh boy, hopefully I can stop by for the stream. Work is going to make it tough though. Oooo, make sure to let us know how you like it! The heart one needed a black boarder for the longest time. Also...  Updated emotes! <:Heart:742212343114629170> <:Drink:742212331228102657> Ayy, that's good. That means you're getting your money's worth. Have fun! And don't listen to what anyone else says about the game until you can judge it yourself. I'll be doing it again throughout this week. And there's always the A Link to the Past stream. I'm playing through Zelda 1 so I can get footage and research for a video. Yup. It was just a casual chat. Nothing big. Anywho, I'm going to be chilling in Game Chat 1. I'm playing Zelda 1 for research. And a good video it was. That's right I did. He's be a prisoner in the brig. I can, but it would require me to remove all your previous roles. Perhaps another time, but I actually am not too interested. If you want, I can make it lower. It simply makes your name harder to read. Your role provides no statistical nor mechanical benefit. I have no power over this. That's alright. I stick to default. The only fix is the dreaded, "Light Mode" Isn't it? Yah, just make sure to push him an even amount of times. Nitro is for people who think the benefits outweigh the cost. Must have been. Goodbye Vader! Ayy, welcome boss! Kind of hard to miss.  I'm glad you got that fixed. It's strange that happened in the first place. same That is true. I still have a history video I want to watch. Yah, good idea. I'll be going afk maties. Man, I don't even know what to do with myself while I wait for the stream. I already went on a run, read a few chapters of Mere Christianity, had my morning tea, and listened to my jazz. It feels weird to play one video game before streaming another video game for 2 hours. I'm gonna have to find something to fill that time. We're playing with the big boys now. Youtube this time. Ayy, no sweat! I'll make sure to stream more in the future so that you can watch if you want too. You're hired. Can you make ramen?  You can, I just thought it was a glitch.  Isn't this your 3rd time leaving? 😅 Not anymore. He's been demoted. Heck, I thought the Fixing BotW videos would appeal to a larger audience. I suppose it's because I am the creator that I judge them so harshly. I prefer my more recent series with my brother. It really is! I'm slightly surprised about that too. I didn't think they're worth the attention. It's a magical place. Kind of like the Lost and Found at your local Elementary School. I'm a hobbyist, not a businessman. Donate? Oh gosh no. We aren't accepting your money. I don't trust robots. no. Ha ha... You can do this in spam you know. 😋 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Nothing. It's just for show. Green is a good color. I might make a role for it so it can be more interesting some day. Boom, it's fixed! Maybe it's a problem with Ranks for non Admins.  Our lives are difficult are they not? /rank Scout /rank Scout Alright, I sold the server to Dodongo by making him an admin. Ha ha, not quiet.   That was a variable.  Try /rank X Well shucks. I thought the bot would work. Let me do some testing.  :D I did that one manually. Hopefully it works, or else I'm suing. It might be a bit slow. Pog That would be 7pm in England. A solid time if I do say. I'm sure everyone's schedules are going to be changed when school starts as well. So I'm flexible. We'll stick to 2pm for now. Well probably move the time around in future streams so it can work with the most people. No sweat boss. We're sure to do more of these in the future. Your in the eastern coast right? This Friday at 2 PM! Oh! That's a little different. I think it needs a nudge and then it will be right. Yah, it's weird but I feel the same. The left one is too far I think. This is what it looks like with the "LIVE" in the center. Thoughts? So long as we don't have technical difficulties I can see this stream being a blast!  Oh, that's rich. I like that. Give me a few minutes I might be able to make that work. That's a good point. It needs to be clear. I just wish I knew how to incorporate the episode number. Anyone have any idea? I'm surprised that so many people like the right one better.  That's democracy for yah. Adios! Just don't spam them please. 😉 Oh boy. 😄 Looks like I goofed this one up. 😋  Next time I'll know what to do when I'm polling the community. Alright, the poll is up again. Okay, I'm getting confused since the emojis are backwards. I'm deleting reactions and starting that over. I do that later. Good idea. It does look pretty doesn't it. 🤔 Which of these look nicer as a Livestreaming Thumbnail? It's actually quite messy, but we've cleaned up a lot of it over the summer. It definitely is! My dad grew up on a larger dairy farm and wanted to keep that part of his life alive as a hobby. It just means that I have to help him out with jobs every once in a while. Just a small one though. Only 8 cows. Yah. You know. 🐮 Sorry, I went afk to deal with something on the farm.  Thanks for the offer but I won't be able to come. Power to yah! I never took the time to understand it. Huh, neat! I don't know how to do that, but it seems handy. Regardless, who runs the server? Just as much I would argue. Bedrock is functional though. Java or Bedrock? Sorry, I got distracted. What Minigames? What kind of event? We're referring to you're conversation with Speedrun. I suppose a bit of generic conversation is a good thing. Yah, I can't argue with that. That was the most generic thing I have witnessed this month.  Oh gosh, I'm gonna be sick... 🤢  Wait a minute, that's subjective!  That's exciting! > tax invasion Oooo, that's a good one. I like that. https://tenor.com/view/invasion-war-no-privacy-no-boundaries-serious-gif-5300944 Dear Lord. I never thought Taxes would invade the server. I wish to play that one some day. https://tenor.com/view/im-ok-with-that-thats-fine-okay-gif-13605585 Confession: I didn't finish Windwaker. I only played the beginning and then my controller broke. 😦 Sweet. It's settled then. I'll post an announcement in a bit. It'll be fun to make videos like that. I'm sure my manager will approve of this idea. RTGame is the bomb. Too bad he swears all the time. We'll be like the RTGame of the Zelda community!   Good idea. I can add that to my excessive amount of playlists. 😇 I like that idea. I'll see you, and raise you one "cut gameplay" video! Maybe I turn the A Link to the Past series into a livestream series? Still figuring that part out. In other news, I want to livestream some time. I'm thinking this Friday, but I'm not 100% sure. Good on you! Go forth and conquer! I see = Icy Nah, I enjoy learning! I can't wait to learn things but not have a girlfriend. There aren't any specific requirements.  That's mostly because we already have enough moderators. But in the future we might start an application process. That has to suck. I can relate to that. Ironically, when my college closed down spring semester it made my finals easier. So my tardiness didn't punish me. 😋 Oh gosh! I hope they're able to finish them all. > out here waiting in case my friend needs emotional support while finishing a semester So are they in the middle of a final for their semester? Well, I was concerned when I saw the first two letters. 😅 As you have just demonstrated, it is not a perfect system. 😋  Better than nothing though. If you swear it will likely be deleted. Not all words are on the blacklist, but a good number are. No ban function included. The bots only exist in order to Moderate chat (swearing, spam), give emotes (by reacting to messages), and send a message to new users.  The bot isn't broken. it just doesn't have those abilities activated. 😄  Yah, you're probably right. A small Zelda Community fast could do my some good. <:happy:725779401031024641> Dang. I just realized that I don't want BotW2 to be spoiled for me, but I also don't want to neglect the Zelda community when the game comes out. This is a dilemma to be sure of. 🤔 (Afk for a minute) It's a lot of effort for something that I don't see a point in. On the other hand, if you all want more ranks so badly, then I can look into a fix. But if I did that, then people would need to spam outside of #spam to get XP, and then I'd have to moderate all the spam closer. I don't want to make a system that encourages spam inorder to get ranks.  Nope. > If anyone wants to play bedrock please let me know (pretend there's a strikethrough) There are mods, but not a lot of them. http://mcpedl.com/?cookie_check=1 Wait, really? No mods?  Also, I'm sure that would be over $1,000 🤑 It isn't needed, but the Interface is constantly reminding you about them. Buying Skins, Maps, Soundtracks, Texture Packs > Bedrock doesnt have adds It has micro-transactions everywhere. They aren't "ads" in the traditional sense, but are just as bad. They are each a different type of Minecraft. Java: - Original - Has large playerbase - Only on PC Bedrock: - On all systems - Crossplay - Lots of ads - No Pirate Lingo I can see that. Then I lost count. I only made it to 1.7 I used to not like Bedrock, but I like it a lot more now that I've tried it.  I know you have Java. What Minecraft version does everyone have? Oh, that's unfortunate. At least he's alright. > havent played minecraft in a while since my friend disappeared for a bit  How long have they disappeared for? > Ur a teacher Yes, congratulations. You figured it out. 😋 I've been playing it for the classes I'm teaching, but Assassin's Creed takes up most of my free time. Also, I didn't know you had siblings! Yah, he wasn't keen on joining.  I think it's because he's obsessed with Minecraft right now. 😁 Thanks! I hope I can convince my Brother to join some time. That would be the best. I think I'll work on episode 2 of A Link to the Past today. That's sure to keep me busy. A bit too average if you ask me... 😒 Average here as well. Alright, so if you're character is a mentally deranged murder hobo then yes, you are roleplaying. But you're doing it at the expense of others. Just killing a fellow pirate isn't roleplay, it's uncreative and makes no sense for a character to do. In literal terms, "To play the role of a character through acting/improv." But in Table Top terms, "To play the role of a character in a world while working with a party to achieve a common goal."  You know, I don't think the word "Roleplay" means what you think it means? My word, yall are needy. :D *You all exist in the West Indies during the golden age of piracy. We have a frigate and are in the middle of the sea right now.*  No. Still can't do that.  Correction, guardians are ancient technology. https://tenor.com/view/obama-micdrop-gif-7413222 I am always the Game Master. And as game master, I hereby declare that this server is trapped in the 1700's. So no cars. Anakin, NO! I come up with everything on the go, so it wasn't planned or anything. Just to mess with people. It's funny though. Wow, that doesn't look very practical. 😋 Yah, exactly. RP=Roleplay. The game master in a Roleplaying game is the one who moderates the game and controls NPC's in the world. So technically they have unlimited power over the world. Wait this was RP? That would make me Game Master! *An interdimensional Deity snuffs the mutiny out of existence by sending it to the shadow realm.* So it seems. 🤔 Touche _Activates guardian beams._ It's from the Metroid Speedrun Animation. Prepare to be exterminated. 😋 **What!** <:mad:730068988301803530> No buts! I want you all to go to your quarters and think about what you just did. Alright, mutiny time over. Everyone go home. They'll short-circuit in the water! Not the bots! Crap. How am I gonna plunder people now! Wait a minute, how did you get those? This reminds me of a gif I should make.  I have been pinged. Who dare summon me? Sure, it's not hard to revive a chat. Goodbye pig! Oh, nice then. I'll have to do that some time. Why not use the announcements channel for the same purpose? Good question. "And all the Whos in Whoville cried that day..." That's awful and intriguing. Amen brother. I wish I was ahead on my work for my job. 5/10 is average right? Wow! That's a high score for how you're feeling. Right at this moment: 7/10 It is true, Discord requires users to be at least 13 to register. But that rule is only put in place because of legal requirements. I see it as more of a guideline. This server is open to all ages. That's why it's "Family Friendly". What a sad ending. I can't wait for the Netflix adaptation. It's not just a game, it's a video game. Minecraft is a lifestyle choice. Cool story. Explain Later! Huh. I didn't know you could do that. That is certainly a struggle. > No one is taking on your sever  Point taken. I'll make sure to give the server away soon. 😋 (jk) Explain please.  Oh, then that is comforting to know. The tip to use vsdc I'll stick to DaVinci for now. Thanks for the tip though. Vsdc? It's not laggy for me, but I also have an op pc. DaVinci Resolve 15 Editing is fun for me. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Thanks! You'll need it more than me though. <:happy:725779401031024641> Meanwhile, I gotta get to editing. Gosh, good luck with the grind. Oh! I see. Excited at all? Moving? As in moving to a new house? Wow, that's awful! 1/10 Would not recommend. I also can relate. It's a free program thought. 😄 Yarg! Of course. :D Ah yes! Bread cloning. I thought we plundered bakeries? A bread army! No problem! And thanks for the suggestion. I don't think I'll be able to switch to Roblox (considering the money we already poured into getting kids Minecraft Accounts) but it's a creative solution. It certainly is!  https://pcpartpicker.com/user/TheBreadPirate/saved/JnPQVn This is a link to my PC specs. Some of the items can't be purchased anymore.   It's a Bedrock Minecraft class (Not education edition) where we have a short lesson and then a challenge in game. Ex. A 10 minute lesson about bridge building, 30 minutes of building bridges as a challenge, and then free-time. It's a mix of both. I'll send a link to my set up in a few minutes. No idea how I fixed it though. 🤔 I agree. 15 FPS is close to unplayable. I had that problem the first time I emulated BOTW. It's a small program, but a big institution. It's named the REACH program and it runs through something called Cornell Cooperative Extension. Our summer program isn't rolling in the big bucks either. 😋 That also wouldn't allow them to play together.  Yah, it's a rough situation.  Good luck making Minecraft videos! It's a competitive market, but I'm sure you can do it. Okay, so the problem is three fold... 1. Their laptop is old and slow. It takes them 10 minutes just to turn it on. 2. They don't own Minecraft. We are lending them a Bedrock account, but their PC seems to reject it. 3. The parents aren't very tech savvy. They're nice people, but they don't understand computers. There is this one family in particular which is using a 10 year old computer. I've met with them for at least 3 hours trying to figure out if they can play Minecraft. It is! (When there aren't technical difficulties) Well, it's not as advanced as electrical theory (these are elementary school kids) but we have a class right now about rockets, and in the afternoons I teach a roleplaying class and a Minecraft Class. Only for the summer in a camp. It had to be virtual this year though. I gotta get back to teaching my garbage lesson virtually. You have my respect! Oh! I've always wanted to be a game developer. I don't have the patience for it though. 😄 Goodluck!   What game is it? That's pretty neat! Oh! I know Jack. He's still on this server. I've been on that server in the past, and I've texted Croton before, but I don't know how my name made it onto the server. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Really? That's strange. Farewell Ello! It'll be much more of a fight. Nope! I'm playing this by ear. To be frank, I'm pooped. Making weekly videos took a lot of effort.  And that was without my new job right now and college in the fall! So I'm investigating ways I can keep making quality without getting worn out. Ironically, I've been winding down with my upload schedule, so I have no idea how the channel got there.  Thanks. Then he's less of a pushover. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Ganon is a pushover after defeating two divine beasts in my opinion. As long as you finish the lightning blight before Ganon.  Ahoy Aaron! Thanks for joining. 😄 It's negative-nothing. It's less than nothing. Nope. I updated the Octorock Emoji! It looks really bold now. <:Octo:735201277973364808> But why would a company shutdown because "it has become too populated". That makes no sense!  If they had a population increase then they would simply expand their servers and encourage more people to join. More People = More Money The logic is also nonsense. Just ignore it. Wack I love the map from Zelda II as well. Also, sorry about this, but I have to get going for a virtual summer camp class I'm teaching. Godspeed gents. I'll be back at 6 I was looking into the map of BOTW and found this masterpiece... https://zeldauniverse.net/forums/Attachment/13004-Hyrule-North-Map1-png/ That region is so pretty. I don't spend enough time there. Great Plateau and Necluda. Oh snap! I haven't done that fight yet.  * Scribbles notes on bucket list * By the time the DLC came I was out of the phase... which stinks. I was so hyped for the game when it came out I just plowed through it in 2 weeks. True indeed! I stopped playing before the DLC was released though. No, wait a minute, I got that backwards. I had nothing to do AFTER BotW1 came out. It happened to me in early 2017. Thankfully BotW1 rolled around. That part was exceptionally weird. You'd think that Nintendo could easily recycle their E3 trailers for a Direct. 🤔  I don't understand Nintendo. They're a strange, frustrating and wonderful company. I'm sure that Nintendo will have a full Direct in the near future. My guess is that they're sitting on a bunch of AAA games, but they aren't prepared to share them. There was an action adventure one which was interesting. It's coming to the US this November. "Merica needs to step up it's game. 😄 And a better presentation in my opinion. Interestingly, The Japanese Direct had more games than the English one. $6 per DLC The Cadence of Hyrule stuff was neat, but it seems like it's going to be expensive. Anywho, who else watched the Direct Mini? I'm just happy that Nintendo shared information with us. Being negative is only going to scare Nintendo into being quiet. The guy who predicted the Nintendo Mini is getting attacked on Twitter. What's wrong with the internet. 🤮 I really gotta stream again. Maybe I could do A Link to the Past then. Amazing World of Gumball > Xavier renegade angel Guru Guru > Raphtalia Huh, never thought I'd see those words in a sentence. I've never even heard of it. But I am also uncultured with Anime. I have not heard of Senko San either. That's fine, I have to get going anyways. Have a nice night! (or day) Hi! But hope is what sustains a community.  Without hope, there is no point to sticking around. Understandable. There's also a rumor that the game will be called "Return of Ganon", but that's just a rumor. I've got my fingers crossed for BotW2 news. There are a lot of Rumors/Leaks going around about a Nintendo Direct next week. Thanks, it should be fun. I'm going to be teaching a Roleplaying Class for a summer program. Good for me. I'm going to be doing some prep work for my job next week. Ahoy I had two slices of toast and bacon for breakfast. Whoa! I've never had one of those. Must be yummy. Hi Clover! I'm having a great day so far.  How about you?  A) I do not own a Switch. I record with the Wii U and my PC. (I'll eventually get one though) B) Thanks for adding me! That should be more reasonable! 😋 All of them! That's gonna take a while won't it? <:happy:725779401031024641> We should put it into a history book. 😄 It was Ha ha, in that case, yes. Yes you can. 😋 Submit it where? We did it guys! We learned how to count. Ayy, that's fine. No need to apologize. Brace for impact. You have no idea. 😅 Oh! Pfft. I didn't notice. Sorry about that. Thanks for joining! Ahoy! And rocks! I don't blame him. I'm so hungry, I could eat an octoroc! Ha ha, food is always important. 🙂 Back! I'm glad to hear you got that resolved. Oh snap! Godspeed getting that working. I have to get going, but I'll be back in a while. Oh no! What happened? How's it going Clover! "All's quite on the west front..." Not much right now. I'll be watching an online church service in a few minutes. Ahoy! Good luck! That's not nice. So no, I wasn't mad. And no I wasn't disappointed. I just wanted to remind you. *disappointed 😋 Um, you know that disposed means "willing and able to do something" Mad? No. Yah. They were at least a 6.9/10 That's nice! Sounds like a great grandparent bonding time. 😁 What did you think about the sequel trilogy?  Darn, I forgot about that part. I guess the other thing the sequel trilogy forgot was logic.  I can agree that the modern Star Wars movies are not as good as the originals. Yet, I hesitate to say they were completely "bad movies". Oh, I disagree! I just don't have the time to engage in a lengthy debate. Chicken? I think I'm gonna get to work on a Fixing BotW script. It's not the most exciting part of the video making process, but it needs to be done! Hecc isn't even a real word  It's fine. Oi vey.  If you're trying to explain something to me, use english. Oh wow! I'm glad it worked out so well. 😁  Congrats https://tenor.com/view/miracle-max-princess-bride-mostly-dead-all-dead-oygente-gif-12754873 <:Vivi:723571545116508220> When I need to do something I don't want to, I tend to complete it in parts. (Ex. A few Hours a Day) It's bad. https://americanaddictioncenters.org/inhalant-abuse/huffing-paint I'm going to bed. https://tenor.com/view/facepalm-really-stressed-mad-angry-gif-16109475 Please don't. I don't schedule streams much in advance, so I don't know. Weird. Oh boy. How did it go? (RP = Role-play) Ahoy! It's only given out when I need to meet privately with people. Yes. Yes he is. Nice new username! Well, that solves one mystery. Is green your favorite color? > Oh no! Was my statement incorrect perhaps?  Nah, I was just messing with you by saying "yes" in a convoluted way. 😇 That is an unfalse statement!  Un-Congrats Congrats Oh! That's more clever than I assumed. I might have to steal that idea. 😄 I always assumed it was a program you left on overnight. 🤔 Hah  Ayy, that's really cool to hear! Not a lot of people saw that video so that's interesting that it was your first. 😋  The notification role can be snagged in the Rules Channel by responding to the Chuchu with a sword emote. That's good! I like average characters who aren't too powerful. * Glares ruefully at Casual Bowser players * Nuts in an Over Powered way, or a good way. Problem fixed! Really? Then you're going to need this... 🧼 Poor Dylan. I hope he smells better soon. It's a bit confusing Are you Dylan? Or is Dylan someone else? https://media.tenor.com/images/041e4145bf203a55e3130fca8c78ccd6/tenor.gif Has anyone used Min Min in ssbu yet? Looks similar to baby blue but slightly brighter. Oooo, pretty. What does florescent blue look like? That's a great choice.  Red is high on my list. Mine is maroon and green. I am stuck in a vehicle for the next ten hours. What is everyone's favorite color? 😋 Apologies for the slow reply. My internet cut out since I'm on the road. You are right that it isn't that hard to make roles and give them out to whoever wants them. But on the other hand, I'm not passionate about doing that. In the future we might make more roles. Well, I am sorry to tell you this, but I don't have plans to add more roles to the server anytime in the near future.  There is a Crew Member+ role, but I have not decided on how to give it out yet. But green is a nice color isn't it? So why do you want one? None right now. Why you ask? It's for the bot.  Not a public role sadly.  Is that your go-to catch phrase? 🤔 Huh, so why did you join? What! How can you not know? 😆 How did you get to this server in the first place then? 🤔  I agree. The grammar standards on this server are giving me anxiety.  Are you sure you want a ban? That's good! Depending on the state, fireworks can be problematic during the dry season. But we can't celebrate Vermont's independence anymore... 😢 'Merica! I'm doing fine. I agree. They work in game, but aren't worth listening to outside of it. I am on general. I like Roaring Twenties Jazz and Sea Shanties from AC Black Flags. I have a strong urge to delete this, but I will resist. I wake up each day thinking, "At least the discord can't get any weirder!" And you guys keep proving me wrong. What kind of place is this. 😆 Good question! I thought the role was redundant to have a streamer role since anyone can stream games in #game chat 1 If you don't know why you're doing something then don't do it. Why not? Why not use a normal wooden chair?  It is two warnings and then a ban. Since the server is still young, we're considering what constitutes a warning and what constitutes a ban. The fire nation is from Avatar. I like it chunkier then. I didn't know that chili counts as a soup! My favorite is New England Clam Chowder. Your welcome! Soup I'm going on a tour now. Later maties! It's really cool and really hot all at the same time. I'm on vacation in the Carolinas. Oh, that's nice then! > tbh, none of us understand, we just do random things with no external thought  That sounds unfortunate.  That makes me feel better. 😉 Yah guys don't make sense to me. 😆 Then why did you send it? Your emote doesnt explain anything. But we hadn't said anything to you? > ok  What are you saying okay too? Oh no. What have I done! *matie Good morning Marie! What are you guys talking about? If you don't like the video, you could always redo it. 🤔 *swabbing the poop deck noises* Yarg! We all go through phases. Someday you'll probably want to go back to it. Whoa, sounds cool. I've never been good at advanced BotW strategy. Oh! What is that? PDR? Indeed I did. Well, I see a lot of oi I suppose not  Stop spamming. Okay, it you're going to use it in a perverted way then it's not allowed. It's a nut Sure. Why would that be wrong. As in nutter? It's not funny. Stop please.  Please rewrite that status message. It is offensive and rude.  No, it's Patrick. This is not the right place to do that. And...? Care to explain that with actual sentences? I dont get it.  Welcome to the server! That's a nice image  I saw that you came out with a video recently! I can't wait to see it. 😋 That great! Wow. I added that part to the rules recently so I hadn't consider that when I originally gave you the role. I can't remember everything you have on your channel so I'd need to double check. But I won't take the role away from you if that's what your worried about. It's an automobile Well, yes. That's true. Rules exist. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ What is up with this chat? 🙄 That's a good idea! I should write that down for when I'm back from break.  You were right about the origins of the word general. It's original meant... "Having overall authority whether about a subject or an army." Don't trust the internet. The illuminati is in control. But I'm not sure. I think it's a linguistics coincidence.  Don't ask random people for subs. Earn them by making content worth subscribing to. 😋 I've never asked for people to subscribe to my channel in the past, but people do it anyways.  I can see where you're coming from and it's not entirely implausible. Yah, I'm not in a rush to make new colors for ranks. The server is only a week old after all. I think there is. Maybe it's a linguistics thing I wonder if there is a connection between a military "general" and the idea of something being "general." Oh or we could use general. I like canned spam I'd be fine with that if you are willing to share. If not then that's okay. 😀 Yah! I'm really curious. 🤔 That's unfortunate. How come? Have you ever had that happen? Well, it is true that Jesus is willing to forgive you, but I doubt anyone will get angry over it. I "pray" to differ! Prayer is very powerful. Even to an atheist you cannot deny the amount of hope it gives people. I'm gonna pray for you then. Well, for starters it's literally "Satan" And secondly, that would keep me from experiencing Jesus' forgiveness. Sounds awful. Gosh! I would never do that. Humans. I like toast too, but I wouldnt use toast for my PBJ. It's boarder line spam. Okay zoomers. I'm going afk. I must not be hip enough to understand. Just use "!" You said you needed all caps, but I think they're a bit excessive. Just use an "!" It gets the same thing across.  My bad, I thought you were complaining about the anti-swear settings bot.  Yah, please keep the chat family friendly. Then you shouldn't have that name  What type of music do I listen to? We're going through some poor reception areas. By the way, I'm on a car ride so I might not be able to keep up with chat. Yah. It's super secret stuff! No. Why? Ahoy  Their content wasn't a good fit for me, so no I didn't subscribe. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ You caught me right once I was about to get some shut-eye. 😅  Welcome aboard! Yah, but I still want people to be able to ping Mods and Admins. Huh, I'll need to fix that. I'm pretty busy today, so good luck finding the culprit! Uh, wack. I haven't seen anyone ping you. And I don't think i've used @.everyone... Depends on what ping your talking about. You mean in announcements? Unique and simple. 10/10 Um, still uncomfortable. What was wrong with Lior? Or a title? I find it strange that you treat your name like a sentence. Why not use a name? It did, but it didn't update yet. 2.5/10 Too long. Just go with the name "Bad Bread" at that rate. It's more creative, but it also makes me uncomfortable. 3.5/10  2/10 Darn it! Now I'm gonna have to go on vacation. Pfft, you got told. 😄 If you lose I'll also go on vacation though, so.... If you win I'll go on vacation! Congrats!  Sure you can! The DLC is 3 years old.  Only two of them... a) Sword Art Online b) One Punch Man How would that work? Nonsense! The role has no benefits aside from recognizing members who came earlier than the rest. The Early Bird role was given out for the first week of the server being public.  Oh, neat! I can check it out now then. Wow, and I thought my puns were bad. 😆 I don't know if that's possible, but I could try that in the future. Yup, we have a custom message for that. Hi Lior! That's okay! It's still up on Youtube. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  I'm not the director/producer of the video so you'll need to ask Random about that. Thank you timezones! Later! An entire chat just for new emoji?! That seems a bit excessive.  🤔  It's an interesting suggestion. That's great to hear! I'm glad you think the Discord is worth joining. 😋 Ayy, welcome boss!  You know this server has only been up for a week right? 😄  As we go longer we'll introduce more roles and colors. Nope. Sorry. I'm okay if they didn't subscribe. Maybe they had different interests. I liked them. They were fabulous. Everyone say, "Hi General!" Yup! General chat has returned. For the next six hours I'm putting this chat into hibernation cause of my mess up. Cool, it's an easy fix then. > _war is inevitable_  Get over yourself. <:Nut:723608947830816778> Hee hee... Alright. I'll put it back. Not much. <:Chu:723608915677413467> There we go. This is much better. 😋 Darn. I guess mods aren't above the law. Strange but amusing song. > WAR CRIME  Gosh, it's not permanent. <:Nut:723608947830816778> Cool. Thanks.  I wanted to make sure it was working. Any of them. Hey,  can you react to my comment? Man I love that little bot. 😄 You got kerpranked. 😄 Darn Oh, ah, errr... maybe someday? Dates are confusing. It was released today I thought Anyone else hype for the Minecraft Nether Update? Randomizers! Oh no. Oh, cool! > I've actually played every Zelda except the CDI games. (If you count those)  That's impressive. 🤯 Ayy, same! I wasn't able to finish Dragon Roost Isle before my controller gave out. I haven't finished WW yet. Twilight Princess is my favorite. Oh nice! Thanks for the heads up. I'll need to investigate this further. 😄 >  have you played Second Wind yet?  Not yet, did they release a build yet? And an Admin. That's a lot of dogs. That's a nice onomatopoeia. Well, if there was such thing as a tier list of swear words it wouldn't be very high on the list, but I do consider it to be a swear word. A good alternative would be Darn/Dang. It's no problem. Please don't swear though. [Redacted for bad language] Well, I'm ready to call it a night. Sleep calls!  Congrats? Hey, thanks for the compliment!   I'll definitely try my best. Thankfully I finished my latest Fixing BotW video. Now I just need to finish the last episode to Relics of the Past. 😅 Wahoo indeed. 😋 I love your avatar. I'm a big fan of The Fantastic Mr Fox.  Ayy, welcome aboard! So as I was saying...   My suggestion would be to take your time with messages and not separate your sentences.  If you're still having problems with the 5 second cool down after doing that then put multiple sentences in the same message. Oh, whew. That wasn't funny. > ok > so anyways > i am getting evicted tomorrow  Oh no! I didn't originally make the check, but I do agree with it. Hold on a moment!  You're writing parts of sentences in separate texts when you could form whole sentences in a single text. 😄  For example, instead of writing... "i do tons and i have to wait" You could have written... "i do tons and i have to wait" Consider this, why would anyone need to text more than once in 5 seconds? Duh. 😋 So that people don't spam. Whoa, that's weird to think about. 🤯  Being in space must feel the same as being in a different country, or a different planet. Kind of like angels hovering over the world. I like how Mae Jemison had her revelation in 8 days while everyone elses was in 100+ days. 😋 That is something I have in the works. Yah, seriously. I leave to see my brother's graduation celebration and come to a complete mess. 😅 You are very talented at it. "In linguistics, grammar is the set of structural rules governing the composition of clauses, phrases and words in a natural language." So I think spelling and punctuation is included. That's more like it! That I did. 😖 At least we don't have any Grammer Nazis on the server. Oh boy  I can live with that answer.  Wait, no more caps? At all? Not a big deal. It was just a lot of caps. [Redacted due to spam like quality] 😋  True I took the blue one Dear Lord this isn't going anywhere... Oh no... 😄  So why did you say "what"? https://www.liveabout.com/thmb/qwty4tQeiKKl9YEBdBtuuREXtek=/1343x867/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/confusedladymathmeme-5ab6ad1d8e1b6e0037eb6fe8.PNG Well then, what's confusing you! If that's the case, then you're likely confused. You don't know if you are confused. 🤔  ? Are you confused? It was fun hanging out with my brother and playing Zelda, but after 3 hours we were royally pooped. https://tenor.com/view/well-yes-but-actually-no-well-yes-no-yes-yes-no-gif-13736934 Ha ha, thanks. Normally we record half that time so this is going to be interesting. I might need to spit it into a part 1 and 2 for all I know. Too bad this video is taking forever to edit. We ended up recording for 3 hours... 😬 Exactly! <:Heart:723962583060709419> I think we should sue them. 😋 Why is there so much Pokemon news but no Zelda news. <:Nut:723608947830816778>  What have we done for Nintendo to forsake us. https://media.tenor.com/images/a5369af4f7b18dae48f9204242e29664/tenor.gif Good morning everyone! I'm going on a run now. I love your username by the way. <:Heart:723962583060709419> Welcome aboard bread! Go forth and eat! Yummy! I love plundering treasure. It's a bit weird y'all are in iron armor though. Oh nice! I can understand why you needed so many players. Jesus is a pretty cool guy. He was so young. Why did it have to be Gabe! That's okay. I'm sure he is going to be moving onto bigger and better things. * Sniffle * But I am going to miss him. 😭 Goodbye Gabe!  Ayy, welcome aboard! Ayy, nice job! What difficulty was it at?  Welcome to the server boss! Oh, I'm streaming on Discord currently. In the future I plan on using Youtube. The entire soundtrack is good which boggles my mind. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9lgBLG119s This is amazing, but why does this exist? It's gonna be a long time before I run out of games to stream. 😄 https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality Yah, I'll send a link even though the deal is over. Anyone else play it? A few days ago there was a deal on Itchio where you could buy 1,700 games for 5 dollars, and one of the games was Octodad. I think that would be fun to livestream sometime. I hope everyone is doing alright this morning.  As for myself, I woke up thinking it was Wednesday. 😅  Welcome aboard! It wasn't super obvious it was a joke, but I can see where you're coming from. That too. It's not a bad looking thumbnail. And I like the way the text is formatted. I have a meeting in 15 minutes for work. Nope, just deku nuts on this server. https://tenor.com/view/star-wars-gif-4878923 I don't understand what that video is even about. Is it just a musical overlay? ~~Imagine having~~ ~~Imagine having viewers~~ Oh, it can be anything. Are you asking me or Ron? (AKA Minecraft) Nice! Oh, well then. Thanks for reminding me? Umm... no? 🤔  ? What was it that didn't work?  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Godspeed gents. I'm going out to lunch now! I started with a laptop webcam. Yah, I've been doing a lot of AC as well... Assassin's Creed Unity that is! 🤯  Done! > yeah i remember playing wii sports once  Which game mode did you try? Which animal crossing? I still pick it up from time to time. It was one of my first two first Wii games. At least Wii Sport Resort is still balanced. From what I understand, in a casual environment Bowser is unfair. But to a competitive player Bowser isn't so bad. For my family it was Bowser that was overpowered. He was too fast and heavy. Brawl was so much fun, but was so unbalanced. 😁 That makes me feel better. To be honest, I can't stand using the Switch controllers in Smash. I still use the Wii Remote better than anything else. I went AFK for a second but I'm back! > ~~I kind of earned a small reputation as the Smash king~~   Oh dear, I don't know if I want to play Smash against you any more. 😅 Did you ever go to those? I plan on going to the Smash Sunday get togethers on 4th in the future. I might be rusty, but It'd be a blast. I don't own a Switch so I don't play Ultimate yet. But I do play on the Wii U with my relatives during holidays. > Most of the characters I wanted are already in Smash, so most of my hype now a days goes towards hoping characters my friends what get in.  That's a good way of looking at it! > Yes, give us Waluigi pls Nintendo. XD  [Insert Sad Waaaaa Here] Thanks! I'm still waiting on Waluigi. 😄 I think I'll stick to Ganondorf for now. It's nice that they're adding more characters though. Yah, they just announced that the next Smash fighter is going to be "Min-Min" It was pretty well done for being a home recording. That makes me excited to see what Nintendo is going to do next with Zelda. Anyone else pay attention to the ARMS Nintendo Direct? Ha ha, no. What do you mean? 😋 https://tenor.com/view/waiting-simpsons-homer-whistle-gif-5694935 That's mean. 😓 It's one of the best ways to increase video quality as well. It's a but confusing to understand at first, but capture cards can be really interesting. Mine was awful No way! That's crazy. 😳 I liked the editing software that came with it. I hate the resolution on it, but it was a great starting point. You used a Dazzle too! That was my first card! I still use the Elgato HD Capture. The older version. That's exciting! What capture card do you use? I'm not **super** busy thankfully. It's just my uncle visiting. 😁  I don't have a criteria for the "creator" role yet, but I like to reserve it for people who consitantly make content. So at least once a month? 🤔 Hero's are cool! I don't know much about this 50 vs 50 thing though. https://media.tenor.com/images/9f0e2015283b24de86f386724a173c13/tenor.gif Jokes on you! I've never eaten at Panera. 😋 I'm a bit busy today, so I won't be as active as normal. But if you need anything you'll know where to find me. Oh, nice! If your read the rules then your officially qualified to do awesome things on this discord. 😋 Ha ha, well... Sometimes we do streams in the gaming chats and people like to share their content in the pictures/share content channels.  I also love hearing what you guys have to say in the Zelda chats.  Whoo, Welcome Green! https://www.nintendo.co.jp/clv/manuals/en/pdf/CLV-P-NAANE.pdf That's cool with me! Oh, and by the way. If you plan on playing Zelda 1 again, I suggest you download the Player's Guide. It was made by Nintendo specifically to help players so they don't get lost. I use it when I play the game. There's no need to apologize. We all have things that happen IRL that take precedent.  During my stream or your own?  You can stream if you want in the game chat.  Good morning and welcome to the server! That's okay, you can still edit the comment!  Welcome to the server! I need to go afk as well. Godspeed! Sounds like you need a heavy helping of caffine! Huh, I wonder why! 😅 Thanks! My brother and sister also act for me from time to time. Not the most original name, but it works. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ2gvOTa8i0oFPQjPVQ0oAg I also have a live action skit channel where I use my face alot. Not a lot of people did. That's alright though. My first face reveal on my gaming channel was in my 100 sub special. The one with Peter Parker. Interestingly, Not my first face reveal. > Well anyways I'm going to go eat my teriyaki chicken with butter lightly salted rice  Deus vult! @pictures? I have a hard time believing that myself to be honest. Then again, I'm bad at predicting faces. 😋 That's good! Cause, I hate to break this too yah, but Link is a video game character. I never got a good use out of his shield. It has too small of a range. Link is a fun choice. I love his projectiles. 🏹 Thanks for clarifying. My main is Ganondorf. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ You must be great at sight reading That's insane! I couldn't imagine doing that. I can play hot-cross buns on piano. Whoa... that's a lot more notes than on Trumpet. And Dance of the Knights I like this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyknBTm_YyM Well, also a few sea shanties, and ragtime, and gaming music, and modern jazz, and string quartet...  Nevermind, you get the picture. You think that's weird... I usually listen to Roaring 20's and Dixieland Jazz. You have a lot of instruments you can play! Trumpet is an interesting instrument with different strengths compared to other instruments. I love it. Faron Woods is also a fun one. That's cool. I'm a trumpet player and singer myself. My favorite Zelda song changes from time to time, but right now I like Linebeck's theme. I want to play Phantom Hourglass someday, but I don't own a 3ds. I love Linebeck. 🏴‍☠️ Really! That is not a situation I have heard before. It was my first Zelda game. > dude, when i press enter to send the message but slowmode is enabled and the friggin screen shakes, it gives me anxiety XD  Ha ha, sorry about that. People were spamming in the chat too much. I love Twilight Princess! Triforce heros? Not a bad game, but not a normal Zelda game. Awe, thanks! I just enjoy talking with people. Really? Me too, but we can't know until Nintendo blesses us with news. https://tenor.com/view/well-yes-but-actually-no-well-yes-no-yes-yes-no-gif-13736934 Thank you. Thank you! Everyone, please hold your round of applause. 😋 But Kenobi is pure! Pure awesome that is. I did! Oh, umm... nothing. 😄 Ouch! Sorry about that. Is that what you mean? I did a baby livestream two hours ago. >  can I have   Thou hath been blessed with the role. AFK Mode Activated Whoa! That would be cool. I didn't know that was possible even. Ayy, That'd be awesome! I'll make sure to give you more of a warning next time. 😉 > i **need** people to watch me lol  Are you sure about that? 😋  Yah, sorry if the time was bad for yah. Thankfully it was just a practice stream. I didn't see it on steam! I'll definitely accept. 😎  You have the Stream Role. Could you test it out for me? I added a "Streamer" role for the Stream VC as well. Ha ha, good catch. I might as well keep that feature. Whoa 400 Dollar Monitor! I'm running on a $1200 PC, so hopefully I'm fine. 😋 I'll send a notification out. For me, on the East Coast of the USA, it's at 3. Indeed It's because of people spamming messages. It's only 5 seconds though so it shouldn't be a problem. Sorry, I didn't understand the question. 😅 Oh, PC Discord Neat idea, but we already have a photo channel. Better Oh, duh! Of course. How did we not think of that. I guess using a ton of caps also works, but then it looks like spam. https://tenor.com/view/yoda-sarcasm-gif-12984296 I see, Sarcasm. My bad. It's hard to read sarcasm over Discord. 😋 That sounds like Self Promotion. No spam please.  ok AFK Mode Activated. I'll be back in half an hour or so. Dungeons and Dragons! https://tenor.com/view/dnd-spongebob-gif-9627520 I like DnD! I play that with my relatives all the time.  Cause you guys were spamming my notifications. 😋 Duh. Yah, yall guys are sending messages way to often.  Send all your thoughts in a single message if you can.  Like this one... I'm a Ditto fan myself. That must have taken forever to get a hold of. Whoa! nice job. I like burritos though Done You got it Good morning Burrito! Whew, that's a relief.      Welcome aboard guys! Sorry I couldn't greet yah earlier. 👋 I'm calling it a night.  Have a nice night gents! Ha ha, that's fine. I'm just glad to see yah arrive! Welcome gents!  Whoah https://tenor.com/view/good-question-meme-shrek-gif-16886109 Pineapples are okay on pizza the word That's a lot of bread. Ayy boss! Welcome to the server! Korok Forest = Noice I think they'll announce a Switch Pro with BotW2 since Zelda games are so taxing on the system. Amen brother I agree! I'll likely get a Switch Pro when they're announced. I want a Switch someday, but I also want money. I use OBS, and I run BotW on my PC through an emulator. I also record my Wii U with the Elgato HD Game Capture. Youtube Content Creators, etc, get yellow tags, but that's it in terms of extra roles right now. Poof! And now the role is gone. :D That was the Member+ role. At this point there isn't a ranking system.  I purposefully don't have an XP system since that creates incentive to spam, and I'm not looking for any mods at this point. We do have a Member+ rank, but it isn't being used yet since this is only day 1. Too blurry. <:Sword3:723608873243639818> I need to get a higher resolution Emote for the swords on the server <:Nut:723608947830816778> Well, it's unique? Umm... In other words, thanks! I know which comments you're talking about, and I can say it only slightly influenced me. I already had plans to do more BotW videos at that point, so your comment was more of a confidence boost than anything. Sounds like a job for, "Bicycle Repair Man!" That's my kind of country.  Just make sure it's simple enough for a 2nd grader to draw, and has a minimal amount of color. It's the only time I was outside the US I went on a cruise through Canadian waters for 40 minutes. I want to visit Europe some day. Especially San Marino.  Oh nice! Another Terraria fan. 😉 That message took way to long to write. Okay, so the story behind "The Bread Pirate" user name starts back in the summer of 2016 (I think). I had just watched The Princess Bride for the first time a few months ago and was obsessed with the book.  Then, while I was making a new character for the game "Terraria", I tried to name him after one of the movie characters called, "The Dread Pirate Roberts." I made a stupid typo however, and spelled out the word "Bread." I fell in love with the name instantly and made a gmail account for The Bread Pirate the next day. And that's why I use the name, "The Bread Pirate." Sorry for the slow response, I was photo shopping My family has a small amount of wooded trails, so I hike on those occasionally.  That's a good way to start. Where are you walking? Treadmill or outside?  Lucky! I go on a run everymorning, but I haven't done anything with my noodle arms. At least I used 60 FPS footage this time!  Thanks! It wasn't my best work, but at least it came out on time. 😅  I'm doing A-Okay  Oh Hi Steve!  Welcome General! That's fine, you can put that in shared-content Are they pictures or something? Whoa! Well, good luck. That's really cool! I don't know anything about 3d modeling myself. Oh, so it involves 3d printing? 30 is fine  You can, but don't write your 5 page senior essay.  I got it 20 words or less is brief. 🙂 https://tenor.com/view/youre-welcome-maui-moana-gif-8323041 I think there should be some keys.  You are sending a lot of links, not gonna lie. Just slow down on it a little bit. > or like they dont have the DLC  That is a fair point. The DLC has been out for almost 3 years. Is it really a spoiler anymore?  Are the things you're saying offensive? That's not nice Is that better?  Welcome! I might need to edit it a bit though It had class.  What is it? *Ta-da!* The Horror Too far! The only doof around here is Doofensmirtz. Thanks guys, but I think I'm fine without those bots for now.  I'll look into that right now  What do they do? Ha ha,  hopefully not Yup Oh yes, of course! Yah, I'll just give up on that endeavor. It was suppose to prevent you from sending messages until you were on the server for 10 minutes, but it isn't doing it's job. Exactly I'm getting rid of that 10 minute timer. It isn't working and no one liked it. I was first Sweet! Better than last place.  Welcome boss! High!  Welcome to the server! Ha ha, well I'm glad you did.  Thanks for those shoutouts by the way!   Welcome boss!  There is, and it is the Moderator position. I'll consider adding a channel to get roles in. Done   Welcome!  Wleomce! [Deleted message since it belonged in "Share-content"] Yall guys are strange.  😋  Thank you. Much spam. 😄 Too many. Emu Joe I don't care that much if you can. I could make a streaming chat for yah if you want though.  Oh, yes of course!  Godspeed!  No worries. I'm just fulfilling my duties as ~~your supreme dictator~~ admin on the server! We might need to add different swords to the channel, like the Silver and Magic sword from the NES game.  I see the similarity, but I don't like it. 😄 > bread give us photo channel :defaultfurret: :SwordDoggoDance: :discobird: I'll see what can be done. Mechanical ^ Nice statue! Weird color scheme though. Good idea! > Oo can we have a pets channel? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztVMib1T4T4 > Dog  Art!  The 10 minute timer is disabled right now. So that's not a thing. Maybe people just need to refresh their Discords or something. I'm not sure. Yah, I'll do that.  It is on which is weird. Wait... no rules? great! Issue solved. Anyone able to see the Rules channel now? Thanks for joining!  That I did! Meh. Thanks Discord. Can you see it now? O, I'll fix that  Welcome to the server boss! Ooo, good luck! We can filter Zeltik if we wanted. 😄 Yup! The Dodongo can do that too. Dodongo already filters out swear words thankfully, but the idea of fun commands it cool. That could be a fun idea someday! What does gaius do? It is a good fishy. There used to be a map that re-created Twilight Princess in minecraft. That project was awesome. Minecraft is a good game. I'm sure it could tide you over for a month right?  I feel that man. I've been wanting a Switch forever as well.  Yah, under normal circumstances the server will make you wait 10 minutes before entering, but I disabled it for now. The talent show was two weeks ago, but thanks! 😄 I have a video that's the same right now. Me and my younger sister submited a video for a talent show but I haven't posted it on Youtube yet. Better than un-decent! 😖 Ha ha, good to hear.  Ahoy there! How's your channel going? Oh nice! It's great to see yah here boss!  That's a great pic! My parents are also a big fan of Thai food. Clam Chowder or Parrot Soup if I'm feeling adventurous. More like Soup. 😄  Ayy, welcome!  I think he means this one? So this Friday or Saturday. This server will likely go public once I upload my final "Relics of the Past" video. Confidential. See yah later! Indeed! Thanks again for the help boss. I have a meeting scheduled with another Youtuber in half an hour. 🏃‍♂️ Yah, I have to admit that my first time on your server I was a bit overloaded, but I figured it out quickly. 😅  It was my first time seeing a big server. Anything you think could use improvement or does it look ship shape? I want to reserve that as a private chat upon invite only. Okay, cool! That works then. I'm curious, can you see "The Office" voice chat channel? The rules will too I'm guessing. But like I said, I made the server as simple as possible while covering some basic areas. It'll probably expand over time. I prefer humans to ai. 🤖 I used to be very "anti-bot" myself, but I've started warming up to them. Oh darn! Well, at least there were other bots. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Booted? What happened? 😄 I use Dyno since it can blacklist swear words. I don't use it for much aside from that. Canada? That's awesome! I went there for 40 minutes once. Usually the Dodongo bot will automatically give the user the "Crew Member" role automatically after 10 minutes, but since we took down the verification I just gave it to yah manually. It's not much, but you got the creator role. 🙂 It just makes your name tag cooler. <:breadandbutter:722164837580537857> Don't apologize. :D Beautiful. I love how you did the hair. That is a nice drawing! "You little piece of pasta" :D Of course I would approve her being on the ship! As long as she doesn't get too bossy. It's almost enough time to make a video. Or bake 1.5 loaves of bread. Dang!! 5 Hours is a long time. This is very good tracing. I still like it. 😄 YOO! I love the description. You did a great job with this!  How did you draw it out? She is! I see that now! That's a clever way of incorporating it. But the rest of it is perfect. I think it needs a scarf! Original character for reference... Thanks Riptide! Well, the moon needs a make-over if it wants to be on this server. It's disturbing to look at. 😄 Look it up. I'm not explaining it in this chat. 😂 The issue is that the image looks phallic. Nice art! Wait, that's really good. 😮 Bob Ross would be proud. Now that is ART! Great job!  That sketch looks fantastic! That would be a sick pirate tattoo. Amen Ginger. That is a fantastic pirate.  How did I not notice the logo on the butt of the gun! Great attention to detail! 😄 It's very rustic. The engravings are nice.  Thanks! Whoa! That's cool. That's super impressive! I would need a reference for that.  That's so cool! The Bake Pirate is a pro at this. https://giphy.com/gifs/steveharveytv-dance-high-five-steve-harvey-3oEdv6sy3ulljPMGdy Ha ha! That's awesome. 😄 That's awesome! Indeed. Swearing is a pretty high offense on this server. No, I'm saying post it in promo, but talk about it in another channel. It is promo. If you want a conversation about it, do it in general. I did like that! Nice sword! Ayy! Have fun Tax! I love seeing outdoor pics. It's funny! I like it.  Ayy! So that's the photoshop you were talking about. 😄 Maybe we ought to have a channel for just bread. Okay, that's enough for now. 😂  Nice bread pics. Turtle Bread is awesome. But not too much spam. 😁 <:Spam:732992447642206290> Creepy, but funny. https://tenor.com/view/90s-reactions-cool-thumbsup-gif-5410472 This pleases me. I am cool with this! It's beautiful. https://thumbs.gfycat.com/DistantSizzlingArctichare-mobile.mp4 At least it's not made of rocks! Hee hee, nice one. This is so enlightening. If only I had a horse. That must be it. Interviewing him would have been cool, but I couldn't find a lead. Nobody knows what the Voice Actor Looks like. I tried to find out. You mean the video of him? Not sure! I'll think about it. RTX. All the way. It's slapstick. I permit it. Ayy! Congrats! That is real progress. https://tenor.com/view/parks-and-rec-parks-and-recreation-ron-swanson-gif-5603552 I liked that. Yall are nuts.  I'm not MADE of bread you picaroon! I plunder bread. 😂 Depends on if you need them or not. Are you having a hotdog/hamburger? Of course they are. If you need something, you can just ask. Yes? I've binged a lot of Morshu memes. Been there, seen that. 😄 Nice! Are you going larping? That's really cool! Nah, it's easier if you hack Youtube. https://tenor.com/view/the-secret-ingredient-is-crime-jbone666-mouthful-building-walking-the-street-gif-16400025 That's epic. That time a pitcher disintegrated a bird. Cool history of sports video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PyCpG06138 Something seems off. [Dies] Well, I guess I am canceled now. It was nice knowing you all. https://tenor.com/view/overthegardenwall-over-the-garden-wall-gif-9325109 Me: Deletes gif because it has swearing in it. Also Me: Gets canceled since he explained why the video was swearing. https://tenor.com/view/oh-no-top-gear-jeremy-clarkson-no-one-cares-gif-18925814 The problem is that ||fatas|| sounds like ||fat ass|| It calls one of the fish a ||fatas|| yes Yuper-oo! That's a fine number indeed. Neat Aw sick! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Yah Sorry Deleted for swears in title Spam goes in spam. 😋 For Bread%? I might make an exception. 😏 I want to return to the run! Don't count me out entirely. 😄 I had it for a while at least. Nope! But that's alright. Whoa. That's cool looking. Whoa. I didn't think about that... 😳 Oh no! Watch for San's laser cannons. Ha ha, butt dial. Did you not mean to call?  😄 Nice bike! Is that for mountain biking? Ah! Knife! 😳 I don't feel old, so you shouldn't. You can't feel old! Ha ha ha.... Whew. Wait, you're serious? 😳 I didn't know Ninjago was still around! Nice. Legos are the best! Do you have any Star Wars sets? And they have lots of pictures which is the most important part! I just got Hyrule Historia as a present too! They're fat, but they're awesome. 😄  Thanks for the trivia! Good to know. https://tenor.com/view/cat-sounds-good-to-me-cool-sunglasses-shades-gif-9881028 How does she talk? Not my cup of tea, but she's cute when she isn't killing people. Scary! Ah... oh... that's not good. 😅 Why is she chewing on bamboo? Hmm! Interesting. 🤔 Looks scary! Aww, that's so nice looking. 🇫🇷 🍞 ^ 😄 I can still horde it. https://tenor.com/view/thirsty-i-need-it-spongebob-gif-11796572 I wish I got that excited over treats. But they just don't hit the same anymore. It's a Matrix Dog! 😄 That doesn't smell like normal apple juice! Ha ha, way to put those pins to good use. 😄  Ayy! I like that Bow/Arrow gif. Very clever. Dang. It's bigger than I thought. I like how you're teaching them to play Switch Still very cute! Ha ha. Any time. Nope. The sneeze is cute though. It was a sneeze. 🥰 Use sound. Yes. Technically, if he's a part-time kitten then he'll have 9 lives. He's living a quadruple life. Yoshi is also a kitten that lives in my house. I probably think it looks like a haybale since I've been playing a lot of assassin's creed. Clever idea hiding the legs with the tail. That's a tough position to draw a person in. Haybale tail I'll definitely consider it for the video! Hee hee, that's a good moment. 😄 I think the eyes look fine in this one! You've gotten very good at drawing the figures in proportion. Ooo! Blue fire. Wink Wink! (Not my jurisdiction) Grr... the puzzle deepens. That would be a fun theory video. Rock-Hard Food is made using minerals in BotW after all. One of the gorons in Goron City mentions that he wants to eat the Gem at the center of the room. Maybe they can only eat minerals? It's a bad rock. Goose is right. It's a dodongo. Good call! 😂 WOW Yah, Nim got it. With the thumbnails! No. 😄 Anyone notice something different? Whoops. 😅 That didn't go well for her. Wow there are so many acronyms. 😳 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ A lot of people played Animal Crossing when Covid-19 hit since it was a life simulator in the midst of people having no lives. It's all the rage in Covid-19 Land. Nope, but I want to. It's a bit dramatic. Also, you'll strain your voice if you use caps too much. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  If you have a problem with it, mute the channel. Not You! Tax. You needed help right? There we go! I helped by deleting it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgj3nZWtOfA No, then you said you know how I feel. So I responded with "I don't think you do" via this gif Very rip. My gif lacks context since Des deleted his messages. 😂 Well nuts. Not the context for the gif is deleted. https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/843/576/df0.gif I deleted it because I thought you were calling someone else dumb. You didn't hurt my feelings Des. 😄 Oh, okay then! That doesn't make sense. I haven't said anything here recently... 🤔 Wait, that was directed at me? Not super mean, but just kinda. [Deleted because it was mean] No one can stop Tax's obsession. It's too late to stop him Komali I like how it turned out! That's fine! Just curious. Yes  I like it better this way! Have you tested moving it up  higher? https://tenor.com/view/no-i-dont-think-i-will-captain-america-old-capt-gif-17162888 When we do, we'll add it. 😄 We have never needed a second one.  I did streams for a short time this summer, but stopped since I didn't have fun with it.  Technical difficulties were the big thing, and I made the streams longer than I was comfortable with. I will try them again in the future, but they'll only be an hour long at max. The white blends with the bright yellow.  Perhaps move the "Daybreak" over the clouds. That way it sticks out more. Maybe he's really okay with things. It's not racist if he's accidentally typing an extra k. He's being silly. 😄 The Music Pirate. I like it since it's shorter and easier to type. I thought it would be funny to see your reaction. I changed it. 😋 One of us! Ouch Nice! Quick and easy food is how I like it. That looks delicious! Was it hard to make? I'm fine with this one. It didn't show anything disturbing in itself. This is going to be awesome. 😂 My father is a health teacher so I have a great source for information. I'll add it to my "Highly Considered" list. I'd make that video They'll be the fittest enemies around! Hehehe, you got a point. I have another big find I want to share as well. But I'm going to wait until Age of Calamity has a few weeks to shine. The Zelda Dungeon wiki updated their article on Bokoblins after my latest video. 😄 Just don't show any nudity mods or scantily dressed Linkles and you're find. WOW that's a lot. Wow. That's not scary to find. Oh no! You found out what I last watched. Oh? That didn't work. I gotta get to work too. Thanks Arch! Youtube is sort of a victim, just like us. They have their hands tied in a lot of ways unfortunately due to advertisers. It's not just Youtube, it's the whole world at this point. Advertisers control funding, and they wont fund websites/tv channels that show controversy. I still prefer Youtube. They aren't as bad as people say. Not sure. It's still missing a lot of features, and it requires you to buy a channel to get started. I've investigated LBRY and their satalite called Odysee. It seems interesting, but not enough to challenge Youtube. Shouldn't take longer than an hour. This is a minor issue for most creators. I happened to organize my channel weird. That's all. No, Playlists aren't implemented into Youtube Studio yet. I will have to go through half the playlists by hand. Deleting the playlist and recreating the playlists from scratch. It's easy to organize the videos inside each playlist, but it is hard to organize the order of the playlists themselves. That is my problem since some of the playlists are "Archive" playlists, yet they show up as more recent than things like "Fixing BotW" Yah, you our channel has a ton of playlists. I'm still not happy with it, but it's better. The problem is that my playlists are not chronological, and it makes it harder to find the videos I want. So I'll be going through them soon to re-create playlists in the proper order. This is what happens when you try to organize playlists on Youtube. 😋 Lots of views by me. Twitter and Discord should swap names. Yah, discord was a weird name for an app. I have nightmares every night because of this logic. That's really nice looking! Close! The Tax pirate (currently calling himself Wax) posted that sign without enough context for us to understand what he means. Read from the Highway sign down if you want context. I have a theory that Tax is trying to say, "Being a mod is like being on a highway since we can go as fast as we want, etc..."  It's okay, I don't either. Tax hasnt been making a lot of sense lately. 😋 Wait a minute... Amen to that. My run is gonna be at least an hour. 😐 Don't you start from The Shrine of Resurrection? That's fast! https://tenor.com/view/coffee-spit-vomit-gross-laugh-gif-12129945 31 Minutes! [Relocated so that general looks neater] https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/722086066596741147/775189347355328512/before.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/722086066596741147/775190077952622602/after_war.png You're right! Very spooky. Early. :D What's special about Sat the 14th?  That is such a great present for a mother! I'm sure she'll love it. Color the ring if you want, but the time it took to make that is probably good on its own. I like it! It's based off the doodles I do at the beginning of videos. Not sure if anyone will find this helpful. 😋 I've been doing research on a new intro I could do, and I found this AWESOME video on how to be a Youtuber. It's made for Minecraft Tubers, but it's got points that apply to everyone. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTbZucYyuTo A funny video about Storm Troopers becoming self-aware. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKppwACQ-qk You'll get a record one of these days! Wow that's fast! Looks like chickens.  Much better! It's a nice thumbnail! Goodness, no bans. It's just not for this server. I don't think "Rent-A-Girlfriend" is very family friendly. Lets avoid conversations about it in the future.  It's not that bad of a thumbnail! My advice; make the text and time bigger so that it takes up much more of the screen.  Not yet! It's still fall. I would. Because Revali is awesome. This is clickbait ^ The claim "Won't Believe What Happens Next" is overboard and meant to sensationalize. Doesn't sound like a bad title. I don't think this thumbnail is all that Clickbaity. It's just representing something from the episode in a weird way. Definition 2: *A form of false advertisement, uses hyperlink text or a thumbnail link that is designed to attract attention and to entice users to follow that link and read, view, or listen to the linked piece of online content, with a defining characteristic of being deceptive, typically sensationalized or misleading.* (This is a better definition. ) Definition 1: *Content whose main purpose is to attract attention and encourage visitors to click on a link to a particular web page.* (This definition is awful since that makes all videos clickbait.) What counts as clickbait? I'm excited to see how it turns out! I believe in you Random! Get those clickers. Try to keep it simple and symbolic. I don't know what this video is about, but that's my mentality. I'll say it is an *interesting* choice for an outline. Might have worked better added a shadow behind it. You have a nice way of making thumbnails! Wow! There really are nice. Were these all for a single Youtuber? Interesting color choice for the words "Cheating"? Why did you go with a bright green outline? Old Spice ads are an art form. Especially the ones from a few years ago. Old Man Spice commercials are also gold. It was meant as a joke, but the Alexa one is real. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnEW6dX_BmU They made a Skyrim fridge app too. It's the Skyrim jokes all over again! It's Hylian I believe. I wonder why he bothers putting it there? Such a no brainer. Zeltik must be running out of ideas. 😄 We all die eventually. I'm sorry, but as a history student I had to delete that atrocity of a meme. 😋 😂  Great bridge! Those ghosts are too cute! I love them. https://tenor.com/view/critical-role-crit-role-cr-c1-arsequeef-gif-18063361 Hopefully you can get to the good stuff soon. Continents? What region are you leaning about? That's important too! Landforms shape cultures and divide regions. What!? Geography is really important! How else will you be able to keep up with world news, learn about different cultures, be inclusive, have cultural sensitivity, and travel outside of your country! Oh, also, nice drawing. They turned out awesome by the way! Spoiler tags for pumpkins seems strange. 😄 Exactly. It's so weird that people talk about it all the time. 🤔 He doesn't exist. Everyone says there is  man in the picture but I can't see it. It reminds me of that picture I keep seeing on the History Memes reddit. It just plays white noise and has a black screen for me. It's just a blank video for me. I can't see this video. No problem boss! It wasn't ill intentioned. Yah, that might be a bit much. [Deleted for hitting home.] The title on Number 1 pops out better though. https://tenor.com/view/kermit-worried-oh-no-anxious-gif-11565777 https://tenor.com/view/burn-the-witch-screaming-rant-gif-17904166 Magic? More like heresy! Burn her!  Congrats Random! The road to 500 is close now. 😄 ^ That is a fair statement. I don't think anyone likes her like Tax does on this server. 😄 Nice job with it. I don't have the patience for that kind of thing. That was fast! Can't say that I endorse the suicidal messages for geese, but it's a pretty sunset. Ha ha! Good idea. Make sure to hire a safety guard as well. I used to do it, but then I worried about losing passwords. That's a shame. But it's not my channel. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ On my channel, I put my bad videos into a playlist called "The Reject Pile". That way, people can see how far I have come as a creator. Oh no! Will it ever be possible to view the privated videos again?  What about that picture did you do? That's an awesome way to get into the field of crochet.  That turned out so well! The pattern is pretty. I concur. The runes were fun. But it would have been possible for Nintendo to keep the runes fantasy inspired by simply changing the item you use. That's a nice gif. https://tenor.com/view/calculating-puzzled-math-confused-confused-look-gif-14677181 I can't say that you're wrong for having an opinion. You said it was "in your opinion" Can't argue with that.  You're correct! That's my mindset with Zelda. It started as a fantasy series, so Nintendo has made an unspoken promise to keep it that way. People can find Sci-Fi genres in other places anyways. 🤖 It's a subjective thing. My title isn't wrong. Correction: Sci-Fi is good for you. Yah, unfortunately I have a hard time fitting the phrase... "I hate Sci-Fi in The Legend of Zelda Series" on the thumbnail, so I shortened it.  The Thumbnail is clickbaity, but the title will be more explanatory. I think that it's a good balance. https://tenor.com/view/the-big-lebowski-jeff-bridges-the-dude-john-goodman-walter-sobchak-gif-5042638 Oh yah. I like the red. I'm keeping it. You know you're thumbnail works when it's the first image you see in your Windows folder. 😄 Should I add the red? I think this video is going to trigger some people. 😅 That was absolutely ludicrous! I loved it!  From experience I know how hard it is to draw Derp Link on a PC (even with a drawing pad). You did a good job! You mean the chat were we talked about what makes a taco a taco? Yah. I remember it. https://tenor.com/view/mind-blown-explosion-mente-explota-gif-7721542 shrimp 🦐 I get what you're saying. 😄 I wouldn't wear it 24/7 since I need to shower sometimes. "I'm trying to figure out the world... One word at a time" That should go on a tee-shirt. I think we're all confused.  We're trying to define "simping" and we're trying to determine if it is possible to simp to a fictional character. Seems more like fanboying. It's an unfortunate system, but what of the "fictional character simping?" Can we call it simping if he can't get rejected by her, and he can't try to get closer to her? Good thing too! It originated from the word "Simpleton" so that means it's associated with being foolish. The word is so new, I don't know if it has a solid definition. Friend-zoned. Or at least ignored. I thought a simp was required to be denied by the woman in question? I don't know what it would be called exactly, but you make a good point Elic. Fiction-Simping? Since this is a fictional character you can't simp to, I'd say 1. Okay, that is less balanced. 😄 Yoga is an essential part of a balanced life. (Literally. Yoga improves balancing skills.) *[The Dark Scrub has been banned] [Reason: Zelda Heresy]* I love the warm hawaiian feel it has! Glow Squid was a waste of a poll. I hope the other mobs get a chance in the sunlight. I didnt notice you made those! How did you do it? Wow! There are a lot of gold splits there. I've been digging through some old Zelda websites and found this tidbit. Scalpers have been messing with Nintendo fans since the 90's! It fits her character, even if it's a bit much.  Too much enthusiasm for you? 😄 This it gonna be so cool. I hope the community can scream loud enough for them to hear. I've heard that people are sending videos to Nintendo to change their mind, but that's being done though third party news outlets. I saw that article last night. Its messes up that Nintendo isn't fixing the problem. ⬆️  My face when reading 12 page essays in the comments section. https://tenor.com/view/baby-infant-toddler-sour-are-you-kidding-me-gif-5490119 I don't blame em though. That's the whole point behind the series.  And if we don't talk about it! Then we'll never learn. It was weird cause they were necessarily being a "jerk." They were objective and non-offensive... But they made super long paragraphs without spacing and didn't like any of the changes being presented. 😖 Tiz the season! On my last video I had one person in particular in the comments section who felt very strongly about BotW durability and frustrated me. I ended up just saying "You make a lot of good points! Let's hope Nintendo fixes a few of those things in the sequel," and leaving it there. 😅 It's unfortunate that we get so passionate about video games. On one hand, it's fun to be invested! But on the other hand, it makes it hard to see other people's point of view. 😖 I have to restrain myself at time also. :D Especially with my Fixing BotW videos. He's very wholesome and fair about what he says. Arlo is also SUPER relatable. I love Arlo's content. I wish I had found him sooner.  As it is, I've only been a fan of his for two months. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc6Rt_FAfQM This reaction is fantastic. :D He underplayed the announcement so much and was blown up so bad. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGIapmHP15g There's a location in the game called "Vault 101" which has a jazz station. That's where my jazz comes from. Correction: It is the music I use in my videos. 😄 I only started listening to music because of a relative that introduced me to Fallout 3. Man, I love the radio in that game. Looks like my oldest tracks got downloaded in 2016. A few of the tracks are 1 Hour Compilations that I downloaded from Youtube, so it's not quite as impressive as it sounds. I have been collecting songs for a long time though. Ha ha, here let me see if I can share my music list. I don't think I have a Youtube playlist that comes close to the same length, but my PC downloads list is pretty big. My word! For a Youtube playlist that IS massive. VGM is perfect for homework. Ayy, that's cool. He must be my clone. No, why?  Did we have a conversation about something I forgot about. 😅 Lexi who? Maybe we should make a music playlist in the future? 🤔 We'll see. It'd be easier if you posted it all in a single Youtube playlist, of course, but I'm not expecting that from anyone. Just don't spam it and it should be fine. I like no swears. I was not aware that "music" was a type of music.  Thank you for your insight Ben. Sure? What kind of music is it? It will be glorious! I didn't make them, of course, but I really want to make an archipelago island someday. My Animal Crossing island dream. (for if I had animal crossing... or a switch) I don't watch Ceave a lot since he seems to specialize in Mario gameplay, but I loved this video. I know this video very well. :D It was a big inspiration for my original Fixing botW thumbnails. Well, yes but actually no. 😄 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6JeF-uB4bE https://tenor.com/view/%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%A1%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%A3%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0-cry-its-so-beautiful-gif-16055428 Sure. Just don't spam guns. I think. 🤔 Guns are PG if they aren't killing anyone. > I thought it said "the world turned upside down", which is a lyric in Hamilton Ha ha, no. I think it was a note I made about how Napoleon's reformations turned society on it's head. Oh nice! Also, pirates use guns all the time. 🏴‍☠️ I've never watched Hamilton. That was for the Napoleonic Era (This conversation probably belongs in the spam channel but oh well.) Oh my gosh. The power. \🍞 Why doesn't this work... 😄 I'm still on it, but I don't check on it at all. I did. But only a few. And I had to have help from the more experienced modders in the community. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4xxny4KRh4 https://youtu.be/gaCjnxlentk https://youtu.be/0Qt0d54MlE8 You have some nice pigs! They're really cute. 🥓 OH! That explains it. :D Thanks for clearing that up. That's three different g pigs right? That's a little different than just a crappy camera. It's head is totally different. But it is a different color from the other two G pigs. But what about the black one? They're multiplying! Yay me! Nice! The hackers left once we called them out. https://tenor.com/view/hacking-gif-9668875 You're probably being hacked... No big deal. 😋 Is this just on your phone? If the problem persists then I'll look into it more. But from what I've seen online this is a rare issue. Does anyone else have this problem? We just made the sever logo a Gif? It shows on my PC and my phone. Weird. It would be weird to have a DLC for a limited edition game. That's a tough save! Nice job Yoshi! It's a feels edgy, but also welcoming due to the color scheme. It's also bubbly and polished looking. I approve. Discord doesn't like the ≠ sign. *Correction to the "="* 500 Subs =/= 500 Friends I appreciate that people like my content, but 500 Subs doesn't make me a better person or fulfill me in life. I care more about the people who are willing to talk in the comments or on this Discord because that is where relationships are made. I do. 😦 It's a bit Narcisitic to pin a  congratulatory card to myself, but I think the doodle is endearing. I like it a lot. Thank you. Ayy! Nice doodle. :D That must have been hard to do on PC. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OSAbdkE60g&list=WL&index=13 A fun analysis of the Hero's Bow in Zelda games. [Deleted for toxicity] 12? Takes a nap with malicious intent. My Sister technically. The fact it is written on a mirror makes it impossible for a photo to turn out nice. But I assure you, my hand writting isn't that bad. For me? No. For you with this photo? Yes. I am okay with that though since I don't want to spoil anything for a future video. 😄 I also paced around for 5 minutes so I'm sure my room mate thinks I'm crazy. Woke up in the middle of the night with an idea for a video and wrote it all down on my mirror.  Thanks for your thoughts. Have courage, like Ike! (at least for someone who's never played the games) I was close! 😅 So who is it? Ike, right? Heck yah. What do you think about the change? At least the vs is different. Ayy! I'm glad you liked it. That makes it all worth it. That's where most of the fighting happened. Did you see the latest video then. 😋 This was the previous one. (Note: BotW Link's shirt looks more grey than in the new thumbnail.) I decided to edit the thumbnail to be a bit nicer on the eyes. Tax Guy is the best.  I can't believe the physics work inside it! I would not have guessed a Hinox had that power. How strange. Cheese Louis! How did they manage that? Gold Tooth-pick time. Congradulations! "i color outside of the lines" The horror! That's some Shakespearian levels of messed up. This hit me hard. Especially when you consider Link's flashback when Revali taunts Link for not being able to fly. That's quality workmanship! Ooo! That's professional looking, and it fits the aesthetic of Fall Guys. Congrats.  Ayy! That's a nice channel you found. Thanks for sharing. That's a combo if I've ever seen one. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT1yjn61md4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUpBeX9TXG4 His animations are also impressive, but not as frequent as his music releases. I'll find a spaghetti one for you. https://louiezong.bandcamp.com/music Just look at the amount of stuff he's done on Bandcamp! (and that doesn't include his Youtube stuff.) No, he's an actual music artist.  He's very talented too. He makes multiple tracks a week and knows a ton of styles. Here's his description of himself on his About page... *"Hi! I’m Louie, and I’m an animator, musician, and illustrator based in Los Angeles, currently painting backgrounds at Netflix. I’ve done freelance for Nickelodeon, Disney, and CN, and have boarded for We Bare Bears, and the upcoming Netflix show Centaurworld. "* Nope. American I think. And I follow him on Twitter. I think so... that's why I'm subscribed to him! Seriously though, don't dislike it unless it really is something you dislike. Really... That's impressive! I've never seen a video get so many likes without a dislike. This is nuts. This guys just released it today and already has 1k Likes, But **NO** Dislikes! **When I heard that Nintendo Shadow-dropped a new Zelda game:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztVMib1T4T4 https://tenor.com/view/umm-confused-wtf-blinking-okay-gif-7513882 Ahoy! Had to be done eventually. Ahoy If it can lead to discussion then put it here. This can go in either or. But how come kid link has the Master Sword? Oh wow! I love the way N64 games look so seeing custom levels is always a good time. About fricking time! Second one. It has better saturation. Need = require (something) because it is essential or very important. I hope people will have more common sense, but we know that there are "those" people. Logic! Learning about history is not racist. That's nasty. You can see it better if you follow the link. It's a video I'm working on, but it is going to take ages to make. It's a compare/contrast of Zelda 1 too BoTW. Link: https://i.imgur.com/nczFJ2t.png My finished notes. Oh, not as gross then. I hate it when it goes down. Eww... gross. I grew up with slow internet too, but just recently (this year) switched to high speed. It'd be nothing. 480 would happen in 10 minutes on highspeed. High Speed Internet can do it faster, but I'm not sure how fast. It depends on the video quality. Sorry you have to deal with that  Oh, gosh, thankfully my internet is a bit better than that. I think it's a worthy challenge, but it's gonna take forever to make. It could easily be 30 minutes long. I still have ~10 other topics to cover and I'm already thinking this videos is too long. 😄 I'm making my notes for my video in Microsoft Paint. Yah, in other words they got lucky that Youtube promoted their videos so much. I agree! They got really lucky with the Youtube lottery as well. :D Their channel is a bit of an anomaly since most meme channels die off really fast. They are. And I should know since I'm subscribed to them. I was born a Zoomer, but reject it. Heck, I'm not Generation Z. I'm the Lost Generation.  Thanks! It's also good for channel branding for me to be consistent. Nah, that's not in the Pirate Code. That's just cause I like it the way it is. Mean while with The Bread Pirate... 😅 I lack the patience for that. So, I'll leave the Cuphead to the professionals. 😋 I haven't played Cuphead and this is impossible for me. It's too much bullet time reflexes. 😄 Must be a hot fire! It's so life-like! 😄 Perfect I'll photoshop this real quick. I looks like a girl holding a chicken wing. Nice carpet. I love that. It's so selfless. It's a shame that Nintendo doesn't support these modders. https://newerteam.com/wii/ The Deluxe Remake has me excited. I'll definitely be playing that. There's a team that's still making levels/worlds/enemies with the engine. The same thing is being done with New Super Mario Bros Wii. Youtube probably has a tutorial that can help. I wish Nintendo themselves made similar projects. I'd be cool to see them flesh out the timeline with it. Holy! That's really promising. Maybe I could do it for a stream someday. Really! I'm surprised I haven't heard more about it. I love the way this Rom looks! It's nuts that it came out right after Missing Link. They certainly are. Me especially. I'll try not to! Crisis averted. I have a new keyboard. (Wait, I thought I was in the general chat) Nope. Not at all. Sometimes it's been typing two letters for every key I press. Other times it types nothing. Welp. After pouring Tea on my Keyboard yesterday I need a new Keyboard. It's the ultimate physics sandbox. It's crazy that someone took the time to figure that out. Yes I made this. No, it was not worth it. HD Quality I question how dangerous a dancing app can be for the USA's national security. Tik Tok isn't that bad. Its just different than what you're used to. Nice camera angle! It's from an Anime that Tax likes. DaVinci Resolve 15. It's free and flexible. I'm exploring some Discords for other small Zeldatubers. A-Okay It's cool. 🧊 I'm saying it in the sense of, "don't worry about it." Ha ha, it's cool. Figure that out first, then we can fix it. Alright. So what's wrong with that. Fitting. 11? Those aren't robots. Those are monsters. I don't trust robots. 🤖 We don't have any. Normally I would be bugged by the spam, but since it's Putin I'll make an exception. 😋 It's a meme picture. This is not memes.  Put goofy in the right place. https://tenor.com/view/spagetti-food-hungry-slob-eat-gif-4985644 Great, because I need to get myself some lunch.  Godspeed gents. > Like using offensive slurs, like the N word  Exactly. On this server we have two warning and then a ban.  Minor offenses are the same, but only lead to a kick. Very well.    Minor Warning #1. I would say the same.    Is it a problem? It's perfect.  Oh no! How uncouth. Oh gosh, that is pretty compelling too. That is some compelling evidence. I guess no anime. Veggies are always good. Unless they're Brussel sprouts. I've never had one! Looks tastey. Darn it. I don't mind it, but I'm curious. Yah, why the ping? And what's awesome about it is that he draws another layer of the inception each day. 😄 This man has been trolling Reddit by painting himself painting himself painting himself. A piece of art! Good reference.  Ha ha, I got that one. 😄 Sounds like something a hostile monkey would say. 🤔 Oh darn! Better hide my bananas Cause it's weird and mildly off-putting. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I didn't even get the joke. 😖 Not ready to eat, but it will be eventually. Depends on the gourd. Some of them eventually turn yellow, while others become more green. That gourd looks a little bit unripe. I wonder what type of gourd it is? Already did. It's okay. You are safe here... *Begins to pull out hot sauce.* Later! Clever Also it costs money... 😖 Ayy, I use that one too!  That looks surprisingly good! Was that done with Paint? That is spam on this server. And if it happens again there will be a one day ban. My definition is not the same as yours clearly.  it was pretty good. Not gonna lie. Could you elaborate on what you mean? How are my messages spam? No, it's not. It's stupidity with minor conversation. Well, not all spam is done on a large scale.  In this server, you guy's sending nonsense emotes back and forth is also spam. Do you? We don't have a spam channel, so your spam us on the wrong server. This is a pictures channel, not a spam channel. Wrong server hippies. 😋 I like Danny Problem solved then!   Yes! You're right. Wrong chat. We better move to  Wack. Is the countdown going?  everyone has slowmo in  Yah, I don't have that kind of budget to get VR Isn't that a VR game?  Ive never played it. I had a cool math teacher I guess.  3 is a nice simple number! Ah yes... The Mark of the Beast. That also was my math teachers favorite number. I can't wait for us to get to 532. That's my favorite number. That's depressing and makes me sad. Good meme. Huh, they have a neat avatar. Is that an AC Black Flags outfit? It's a cussing good movie. You captured a wild Eevee! Critical Hit Doll Darn. Sorry about that. At least you can go through walls now.  Fine, I guess you can have your bread back. Sure, here is one... 😂  Ahem, I prefer the term, "Plundered" Pffft, let them eat cake. 🍰 Zoink. That just got plundered. 😄 Then cut your halves into fourths. That way you can get two sandwiches. Cut it in half. Then you'll have two slices. The rest is mine. 🏴‍☠️ Sure. Here you go... Zoink! It just got plundered. 😇  https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/723575869146136656/725764421070225428/001422261.png It is an acceptable mistake. 😉 > i just thought it would be seen as inappropriate and it would get removed  Why would that be seen as inappropriate? https://media.tenor.com/images/ae5ae70674472fdd2841667c2b0aec5c/tenor.gif Yah, and? > DIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  That's not nice. <:Fishy:722164604595077253> Indeed he does. I wonder how long it will take him to notice I did that. 😋 [Redacted for being weird and mildly inappropriate] It was a strange conversation. 🤔 I have an outdoor cat, so I can't get him to pose for me. 😖 Sweet! I'll get them up right now. Hopefully it is! That would be great. Can they fit onto Discord or are the file sizes too large?  My word, those are fantastic! And they match the BotW aesthetic perfectly. 😍  Do you mind if I share the link to these photos in the description of the "Fixing Rain" video?  That is a lot of dedication to art. 😋 I think it's art. Isn't all bread like that? Looks like Minecraft Bread Yup! <:link:723660623489269850> Ew... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Cause I don't want to. No thank you. I'll edit it, but yes I like that one. Well, it's not the worst thing I've ever seen. no Ha ha ha.... Hmm, let me think about that one for a second.... Uh huh... and... No. Okay? Shoot. If you two do start working on a keyboard together, could you do it over Direct Messages? 😉 👌 Well, to be fair, it's a very specific skill to have knowledge about. Have you done 3d modeling in the past then? 🤔 No, it was just really abrupt. Like, derailing a freight train abrupt.  Are you talking about the keyboard again? It's like free DLC https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/8525 I find a link to show. I don't use it myself, but I love the music she used. The Lylah Music Overhaul is awesome. Yah, and if it's a sign for a shop then it'll have words on it right? Oh, so you need a calligrapher. Start simple and work your way up!  Art I did. Octopi? Or Octopuses. Why is it with an octopus? If you say so. But I don't want people fighting on this server.  Please don't antagonize Loir. > and heres one my most unluckiest moments in the game  Wow. 😬 That's gotta hurt the next morning. Hyrule Rebalance is a mod for the game which makes things more difficult. I think the first PC my family had was XP, so I didn't ever hear that Sound effect growing up. I like how the sound is from the old computer start up. I'm 532. I got bit by a vampire so that my life span could be longer. Yah, since my Dad is a health teacher I can't really use a cigar, so a pretzel works. This is me while playing board games. Yes? You're welcome Thank you. I will need it. I am extremely close to finishing my latest video, so I will have to pass on the VC. I need to binge edit. Right.... Because Texans are the only tall Americans? 🤔 😂 Maybe Look at the channel description. Aw crap. It's too late. You'll make it cry. Don't hurt the channel's feelings. Whew, that's good. Ayy, that's not bad. Those sell for at least a 1,000 right? Drat Yup. I'm a speedrunner. 😄 Last month I like plundering! But sleep is more important. 😅 The same could be said of Mario. In BotW and Age of Calamity is is said that Link is mute as a way of cooping with pressure. It seems Nintendo has no idea what it's doing with Link's family. 😅 Fun fact, Zelda was Link's mom in the first comic made for the series. Pfft. don't be sorry. You're right about it being weird. Not sure if I could concoct a video from it. I don't know what I'd say. IRL, Nintendo probably wants to avoid the effort of making more characters. Or they don't see family members as essential to the plot. In Game, Link is orphan prone. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Right now, I'd prefer to avoid voice chatting if I can help it since I don't want to bother my brother. But I'd still love to hear the idea. I can VC now if you're available? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av2rPk5gSYc https://tenor.com/view/old-man-next-time-gif-9388561 Noo! https://c.tenor.com/p-Lg-1C0eucAAAAM/sus-fry.gif   Did something inappropriate happen?

My skin is derp Link) Me and my brother made this in survival. Get addicted to something else. They'll cure your addiction. yes! But I'm busy this weekend. I'll consider that! Really? Wow. I applaud you being able to find fun in the smallest things. But is it fun to fish? All you're doing is staring and waiting. How can fishing be so mesmerizing. 😄 Yay! You're one step closer to recovery! I've done that much gaming via AFK. Never a straight session. Not sure what all that means.  I approve! Needs more dittos. :D He's the best NPC https://tenor.com/view/-gif-4519334 They deserved it. He's guilty. Look at his smug lil' nose. It's more of a what statement than a why statement. He can't go back and change what his first game was. Do you want to know why it was his first? Mario Galaxy pride for me. I haven't played Sunshine yet. Sunshine is a bully like that. Wow, I've never heard of this problem. Have you tried resetting? Has the internet give you any help? Ehh, I can't tell you what that means. Have you checked in with the Black Luma to see your observatories? Have fun streaming guys! Sorry I won't be able to join. Single Players are a great way to blow off steam. Especially the fruit slicing game in Wii Sport Resort. Ultimate can feel like that sometimes. I did really awful last sunday during Smash night. ^ That would be nice. Hmm, I'm not a professional at this stuff, but I would just make it a two block wide island that stretches to the middle of the room. Animal Crossing home designers do that a lot to make rooms feel more dynamic. It's called Sectioning if I'm not mistaken. 🤔 You could make an island! You know, like the ones found in kitchens? Shaders? No. Texture Packs & Mods? Yes. I used to use texture packs, but Ive since come to like the original. I might get the faithful pack though. Huh, I must be texture blind. 😋 Looks like vanilla to me. I love the 5x5 house that sticks off from the main structure for the stables. The roof is also satisfying to look at. I love that one! But there's always that one hidden coin. 😄 It's nice when certain coins are optional. 😅  I know the galaxy you're talking about too! Luigi is slightly different from Mario since he has less friction and he jumps higher. Finish the game 100% as Mario, then Luigi is unlocked. :D If you 100% as Luigi then you get Grande Finale Galaxy. 4 stars left. 😄 (if you're on Luigi Mode) Most purple coins do. 😄 Have fun Orange! Aggg! I hate that. Waluigi is next. It's real.  And I don't believe it still. Ooo... I'd love to see some Zelda enemies added. My guess is that we're getting Ditto.   Ditto is well overdue for a Smash Bros invitation. 😄 Green Stars are tricky sometimes. That's cool you got to experience that. I'm a little jealous now. That must have been a painful landing right? "Safe" https://tenor.com/view/dive-tub-summer-gif-5789350 o_o Ooo! What? I regret that I do not. Yes That's understandable. I think I was the same way when I played it back in 2012. Looking back on Gold Leaf I don't mind it being that similar. If Gold Leaf and Honey Hive had switched domes I would have thought Gold Leaf was the better of the two. (Which seems kind of silly looking back on it. Each galaxy is fun in its own right.)  So are you saying that a galaxy is disappointing when it is similar to another galaxy? I can live with that since I like the fall feeling. Too bad it didn't come up in the game very often.  Ha ha, not quite the same topic. 😄 Huh, skating must not be everyone's cup of tea then. 🍵 The music in that galaxy is kick-butt too. Really? Loved Freeze Flame Galaxy. Nothing. Just talking. https://tenor.com/view/party-minions-dancing-gif-4246425 It might have been one of the last levels I completed. 🤔 No, that's a tough one. I remember having to do that run MANY times when I was younger. Poo-doo I'm alive and well! Hi tax! https://billwurtz.com/ ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I'm not sure. Maybe it's being blocked by a bot. No She sent you the dance or the smiley? Yah. I already do that with my PC That's a lot of Military service! God is cool. No kidding! Yes.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KneeqicUJN8 No, we have a Blue Chu Chu *[Yoshi has been banned my Local Admin]* No! Not you too Yoshi! We don't use the chat often enough for it to matter anyways. Maybe in the future it'll be added though. (I don't trust Robots.) If you want music then pull up a Youtube playlist. Why? I am "guys" Car-Man! Cars are cool Nope. Nah, no stream. I'm just chilling. Well, I am here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeWC9V2qH-8 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/722086066596741147/746164767462391948/2020-08-20_20.31.08.png?width=1278&height=677 Baby-Stream of Zelda 1! We're defeating the final dungeon. @everyone Why are you typing the word "sword" twice?  You should have used more tax evasion to get around paying the bank. 🤑 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ2gvOTa8i0oFPQjPVQ0oAg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awX8UQSTc-s In the stream <:Octo:726143202436055081> Oh boy... Splat Bam! Darn. Sorry about that! Thanks for stopping by guys!  That music is so over the top. 😆 Ripe Rain is a way of life Drill = Best Mining Item You're fast.  Whoo, Nice job! Fixed!  Thanks for the tip. Muh ha ha! Good content requires starting work on content. No idea. It depends on when I have time. I suggest we remove  and make people send suggestions through  To be honest, I have too many ideas for videos. I don't think I need a channel like this. But I'll consider it. I might implement a color system this summer when I have more time. 🤔 Maybe! I have never seen a music channel that was used more than once or twice. But we can consider it. I can update it. I know we just had a server announcement about keeping this channel serious, but it's alright if we suggest emotes here. Why not! I'll make it now. I think the Cucco Suggestion is legitimate. Yall want it as an emote right? Interesting idea, but denied on account of being too niche. It's kind of weird, but also understandable.  I already got lots of requests from people I don't know. 😄 Yes. I would like to.  We have some exceptions, but those were from when the server was starting. So a "questions for bread" channel?  I currently have enough ideas to keep my channel going for 2 years, so I'm good, but maybe in the future! Open to the public please? Hee hee. 😄  Behold. The fabled 2nd General chat. It'll get crowded otherwise. We are having an influx of members. We need multiple channels so that people can find the conversation that fits them. I can reign him in a little bit. But I enjoy his ideas. He's enthusiastic. That's good. Good save. 😄 Except Hardtack which we also have a soup for. Well, to be fair, pirates don't have very good dental plans. So we can't eat a lot of hard stuff. As a pirate, you have to work with what you've got. That being said, we have all sorts of soups... - The Aforementioned Parrot Soup - Gunpowder Soup - Stone Soup (With real stones) - Hot Dogs (sometimes Hot Cats) - Rat Soup - Seagull Soup - Shark Soup - and Pirate Soup of course! We are culinary masters in our own right. 😋 What! It tastes like chicken though.  🐔 = 🦜 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMm0SL92Pu0 It's a real thing too. In 1873, Australian explorer Ernest Giles wrote: > On reaching the camp, Gibson and Jimmy had shot some parrots and other birds, which must have flown down the barrels of their guns, otherwise they never could have hit them, and we had an excellent supper of parrot soup. Usually our dog can't catch anything, but we got really lucky with the recording. That's interesting. Later! Yup! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzrdsE1y0oI This is my dog. *her 😋  She's named Jenny. A real cute dog. I have an outdoor dog so I can't relate. No! Yay! Ha ha... NO! Yah, for now. But there will not. There can be. Why should you? No Yah, I think his emoji role bypasses it somehow. Problem solved!  Fixed! By the way Lior, I've had IRL friends say that they love the countries game. You outdid yourself!  That would certainly complicate the game. 😅 https://youtu.be/hnwOkxmcbpQ https://youtu.be/sZ54mBZk-3g https://youtu.be/clupn7G655w And occasionally video game music. Oh! That's a good question. Lots of jazz, swing, gypsy guitar, ragtime, orchestra, Dixieland jazz, big band, and reversed/slowed songs. I was responding to your music comment. Same I'll fix it.  Whoops! Didn't know if I did or not. Nice, I fixed it! https://tenor.com/view/picsou-scrooge-mcduck-bah-gif-6105583 There we go. That's more like it. Bah humbug! Not so fast... Neat Done! I thought we didn't want threads because they were hard to moderate? It's for people to make polls. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ People wanted to quiz one-another, but the online polling sites were deemed unsafe by Lior. So this is the compromise. Perfect. 👌 Just warn them about it verbally. They are new and probably didn't realize.  By the way, I might have mentioned you in the video. It will be way easier this way.  I think I'm going to take your advice and split the video in two! And if 4 months is too long, you can take half-semester courses. It's great for when you hate yourself. You mind if I potentially add this fact to the video? Wait, really? 😂  That's hilarious. I knew you could pin Arrows (cause of a gamespot video) but birds are new to me. OOF  Hopefully you were able to sleep in.  I saw you gave my message yesterday a thumbsup. Does that mean you approve of calling them "tops"  Wow! Thanks for that wonderful Fun Fact! I will now definitely add it to my video without fact checking it. Thanks for the tip! What should I call it in the video? A top? I am sure you have a Fact hidden in your brain somewhere! I find a lot of them via Reddit/Twitter, but this one I found myself. There are identical in design Look at the tops the women are wearing. I just realized yesterday, and want to add it into the video. Sounds like it has been paying off! By the way, did any of you realize that the cloth above the Gerudo Clothing shop is a giant bra? :D Thanks for being the resident vocabulary chad. It confuses me too... thankfully you don't need to worry about that when the script is read. That's why I couldn't find anything. Ha ha! I was playing a game of Eye Spy to see what was different.  Not a bad idea.  I like that hook! It's dramatic, but grounded in reality.  Good questions!  I already have 29 facts, so I am set in that regard. The slowest part is the Footage Recording and the Editing, but the script is done already. Ahoy mods. I need some advice. I am working on a video called, "29 Usless Facts About BotW", but it is taking a long time because of the sheer number of facts. Do you think I should divide it into two videos so that I can release a video sooner, or should I push to make it one BIG video? Okay, weird that it took me to a different message.  It is good you deleted that. Or did your link bring me to a random message? I thought birds aren't real was just a joke. Is it connected to real world politics? I'm glad to hear you are doing better. Sounds like you had an outrageous amount of work. Have you had a chance to rest now that finals are done? Thanks for the feedback. It's clear this isn't something we need to do right now.  Maybe when a holiday comes we can do it again, but not for a random date. No, it wasn't intronzic who suggested it. It was a completely different user. s! I got a DM from a member of the server saying that although they love Discord, they feel like there is a lot of time wasted on it and it would be healthy for everyone if we shut down the Server for a few days and had a Discord-Vacation. I kind of like the idea. We could keep it as short as two-three days if we wanted to. Thoughts? Oof Does he not research? What makes him unreliable? Wow, I watched part of his video on The Dark Side of Electric Cars and it's wild. He's really good at editing. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Interesting.  I might use them to help with quality and speed. I hear those are good for websites. Also, what are your thoughts on .webp images. I edited the lines on the SVG's by turning them into images in my photoshopping software. Actually, wait a minute. Maybe I can export images as SVG's from my editing software. Some of the icons were thin when I found them, so I fixed them by making the lines bolder. Hmm... then I will need to consider it.  It will be tricky though since some of the images I am using had to be edited as PNG's to look the right way. You're right. They are close. Will SVG's help a lot for a website like mine? I'm not using that many images aside from the Logo, Banner, and Icons. Can I turn a PNG into an SVG? It even has a live preview section. I'm using a software called Brackets. It's open source and works pretty well. Happy Mothers Day yall. Wait a minute... it's acting up. There's suppose to be a banner on the top of the white part.  Oh well. You get the idea. No way!! I would subscribe to that 100%.  In my web class, I'm working on my final project. It's going to be a website for the channel and it's coming along pretty well. I got the layout of the homepage done an hour ago. Let me send the file. You know, I'm something of a **coder** myself. 😏  *Looks at HTML and CSS* But seriously, I can help with that. I'll DM you a few tips. Video scripts or coding scripts?  Sorry to hear that. Hope you feel better soon.  SWEET!  Wow, that sucks. Good luck getting that fixed. I'm here to support you whatever you decide to do with it.  I see. If it is bug fixes you are worried about then go ahead. It is your baby. Then, when the next season starts you can boot up the game emulator.  In other words, having it available for just the spring or summer etc... Yah, I have friends who love the game and would love to see it continue. Maybe we could find a way of making it a seasonal event?  What makes you want to end it? A really foamy ocean. It looks kind of like the ocean still. Oh, I see. The role showed on Komali for me. What? That's odd. Oh yah! That was who it was. Actually, I saw one other person with the Oceanographer role. If we do that, then it might be too dark to see. I'm going to try making the Oceanographer's role lighter. Maybe that will fix it. Someone made the suggestion that we make the oceanographer's role more different from the  role. Any ideas?    Also, this summer I plan to set aside half and hour each day for Discord, so that will help.  You got fired by Fiverr! That's a load of crap. Summer Break. I would love to!  have you been documenting your accomplishments somewhere? Seems like the kind of thing that could get popular. Ooooo! I love the idea of an actual interface.  Do you think you are the first person to do this with Discord? Ah, gotcha.  Regardless, Congrats on getting the emulator done I thought it'd take at least a few days. That was fast. Just look at the trending tab on YouTube and you will see what I mean.  There will still be traditional YouTube thumbnails, but exciting thumbnails will continue to dominate in terms of views. That is my prediction. It's only clickbait if he exaggerates of lies. Otherwise it's attention grabbing and that requires talent. That is the longest title I've ever seen. Oh my gosh, his latest video's title. 😂  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eN-Z0EvxFoY Whew, that's a relief... Thanks Yoshi. OOF I better stay small. 😄 Ah, makes sense.  It's good to see you're not letting the bandwagon control your preferences. At the very least, it's good to watch to understand what is trending.  If you've never watched a Beluga video I think you should give them a try.  I know several people, kids, family, and college students, who enjoy them. What should he put instead of a ping noise? Otherwise it's just silence. Interesting, I thought the pings were clever since they keep your attention. The editing? As a YouTuber, I'm interested to know what you dislike about the way he runs his channel. That way I can avoid his mistakes. Ah, that makes sense. I thought you might enjoy Beluga's content, being a discord enthusiast yourself. But, you make a good point. I like them, so that's why I'm considering giving them a try. Lior, you are a mod on like 37 different servers. Why do you think it's a bad idea? I want to make Beluga inspired videos about the Zelda series. Is that a bad idea?  That's a good idea! I'll try that. Probably not. I was thinking the same thing after changing it. Is there a way to make all of them on the same level? That makes sense, Lior. Good luck with your project! As for the game, would it be possible to try Zelda 1 and, if that doesn't work, try Pokemon?  I agree, but since Zelda 1 is very action based it would be harder for people to defeat enemies.  Absolutely. That sounds absolutely bonkers to code.  Seriously? Like, you think you can do that? Ha ha, I think Ron is right. It's probably harmless. (Just checked! Nice.) Did we bring it back yet?  You are a devious man. I like it. 😂 I am not doing anything, because I have so much homework. Glad it's gone. That image could lead to some extremely unfortunate outcomes. Finally, we have a way of fighting back against the AI's. Ha! I'd like to see them steal out jobs now. You mean he blocked it like it was a user? How is that possible? He *Blocked* a bot?? Yah, ban. I'll try to be better with messaging this week. Nuts! I was really distracted this week with a Skit Video for a college show. 😅  I like the idea of rewarding people for participating in the countries game! We could make new colors for it and everything. That was a lot of messages in a short time. Oh, right. Thanks. What? Deleting which role?  From this point forward, mods can give the  Role to people. Keep the second strike. I'll give you the captain role so you can do whatever is necessary to make that channel happen. No rush of course! Take your time. That sounds like a GREAT idea! That should keep people engaged and give people something to talk about. Good call.  Komali is a good friend of the channel anyways. I talk with him all the time.    Thanks for covering the "incest" problem. Dang! That is a mega chad of a man. I knew he was going to die in the country if he stayed, but that is gutsy to claim it to all the other leaders in Europe. That is very brave of them. Yah, he dropped the ball on his analysis. He also claimed he is invading inorder to stop Neo-Nazism. It's ridiculous. Agreed. Putin's absolutely in the wrong and it is despicable. An unprovoked attack, with little to gain, and against a nation that actively wants peace, is flat out evil. If people want that information, they will seek it out. This is a Discord server for a gaming channel that posts fun fact videos about a kid's game.  This is not the place for Ukraine updates. That would be the BBC or NBC. Good idea. I will do so after I complete my current HW assignment. Well said Clover. If people want to talk about politics, lets encourage them to DM one another. That way we don't have to deal with the misinformation and potential arguments. Article 5 is a defensive article. It only applies if a member of NATO is attacked.  At this point, NATO has said, "We have decided, in line with our defensive planning to protect all Allies, to take additional steps to further strengthen **deterrence** and defence across the Alliance. Our measures are and remain** preventive, proportionate and non-escalatory**." https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_192404.htm 1) The Ukraine is not a NATO country. Unless Putin directly threatens a member of NATO, the West will remain neutral.  2) Moderating a politics channel will be a nightmare, and doesn't fit the purpose of the server.  3) We used to have a  channel but it was plagued with jokes and non-serious content. Did you time them out? :/ Ha ha! It would be a wild experience. It would be pretty awkward if we put them in timeout a day or two after an incident occurred. They'd question why it took so long for mods to respond. If they do it again, time out.  That's alright. I'm busy this month too. Take as much time as you need. If Simon does this again, we can point to rule 6. Otherwise, time them out. **Rule 2:** Before: *Listen to . Refusal to listen to mods will result in ban.* After: *Respect 's, they are people too. Refusal to listen to mods will result in a timeout or ban.* **Rule 6:** Before: *No politics!* After: *Avoid controversial topics associated with politics. Exceptions can be made for historical discussion.* I'm going to adjust the rules so that the mods can have a little more power over this type of stuff. They **are** pretty arrogant about this aren't they.  Also, their definition literally admits it's connected to political science, so what's their deal? Ha ha, I understand what you mean. Yah, it's tougher but fun. Kind of like building a lego set. It's also open source which is cool. It's not like Wix etc. However, there is a Wordpress.com (which is different) and works like Wix. Nah, we do everything by hand in our class. It's meant to be an introduction to html so that we understand what it means.  Wordpress is a content management system that runs over 40% of the internet's websites. I've never used it but I heard it's an industry standard. Nuts, I'll have to ask my professor some time. Doesn't Wordpress handle CSS too? We haven't gotten to css in my class yet but I am already intimidated. Neat! What made you choose those two? Going with a simple and sleek look. Nice. How did you make the website? Wordpress? I love how interactive the website is! It makes it easy to know what is a button and what isn't. This works great as a portfolio.  Have you considered what you will do with the edges of the screen? Seems like the sort of website that would work well with a center column layout. Like this... Huh, that's odd.  Moist Coffee says he also tried the name "c0ffEE" and it was rejected by the bot. Was that a glitch or something? The name has no unicode. Probably from the Windows + Period Button hotkey. Oh! Interesting. I will let Moist Coffee know. He'll understand if it's the bot's automated response. Moist Coffee said he got a Timeout for changing his username. But I had given him permission to use the unicode in his name. I am undoing his timeout. That's a new record. 😂 Okay that's good. I didn't know what would happen if we both use timeout on the same person. Wait, did you put Bard in timeout too? If the only rule he's breaking is disrespecting mods, I say we just use the Time Out feature. No worries. I don't mind ping. He started hating on the mods. Not sure what triggered him to act out like this. Good call Lior. AH! I agree with that statement. So, you're saying discuss about announced games counts as spoilers?  Discussion on the Direct shouldn't count as a spoiler, should it? It's not revealing story, etc. Ayy, thanks Lior! Thanks This is how it turned out. We have our first class on coding HTML tomorrow. But we already had a homework assignment where we did a little bit. That's what I am learning as I do it. It's the CSS that does the heavy lifting. You deserve a break. I am learning HTML and CSS in my class and understand the pain now. It's so streamlined.  WOW You outdid yourself with this bot command system Lior. This is exactly what our server needed. NICE! Well that stinks. Scarf for instance has been a regular for over a year. He's fine. I am fine with them staying. It's better that they hang out on a family friendly server like this one, than get kicked out and find a more toxic one. Most of them are somewhat mature as well. Oh yah, this question came up when the server first started. Yes? Why does our bodies do this to us?  I got mine 5 days ago and I got drop kicked by the side effects. I'm going to be hit as well, but I'll be fine. My college is robust. Yah, make sure all of you guys stay safe. But this doesn't warrant a warning or strike. It's in a grey area so anyone feels uncomfortable with it it can go. Okay, then. That's fine. He isn't supporting it. It's an incredibly random and weird comment but seems fine, even if it's in a grey area. Clover you're on fire with that pun! You deserve a 20% raise. You know what... you got me there. 😅 If it were a different meme I'd agree. But bread must be upheld. And? Look at the name of the server. But I disagree it's being spammed. It's a bread channel. Of course people want to use that meme. Ah, I think the GIF was posted with the comment. That explains it. It was posted in   There was a gif of Bread falling over that was posted by beanPotion (MoistCoffee), but it got deleted a few hours ago. How come? https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/398208453581209608/932399397860433950/unknown.gif "Youtuber Causes International Bread Shortage" Plundering Bread is a good cash grab. It has a built in welcome feature. Dyno will take over. Actually, I just checked and most of the functionality we needed Mee6 for is obsolete. We used to need it for temporary bans and muting, but now It only handles the welcome message. , I've changed my mind. We can remove it. I'm going to miss Mee6, but its not serving a purpose. NFT are dumb, but not adherantly immoral. The bot is staying, but if you want, we can rename mee6 to "NFT's Stink" for a month (or a similar name). Despite NFT's being stupid, I still want to keep the Blue Chu on the server. It gets the job done and we aren't required to use the NFT functions of the bot. Yah, I need a better explanation before we can ban the Blue Chu. Oh, you mean the bot. I thought you were talking about someone named mee6. Have we muted them yet? Ta-da! Ew, that's gross Alright, thanks for the tip. And have one chat for a day or two? Are there ways we can prevent that? Are you saying it will be too much spam / toxicity for one channel? I don't think this server is that toxic. Why is that? Following the success of shutting the server down, the next challenges  should be: - Only having a general chat for a week, so all conversations are on a single chat. - Meme challenge where you can only post memes. No texting.  Thanks! you too Yoshi! Time to shut down the server for the holidays!  Thanks for the reminder Lior. Done! Good question! It's as easy as giving them the role strike #1 I think this was a successful prank Okay, tried it out and it seemed to work. They will be out TEST MONKEY!! Muh ha ha ha! (Oh dang, this power keeps going to my head) Actually... wait. We can test out the new mute feature on them. Yes. That is well deserved. And delete it. I can change your permissions to fix that. I see this as an absolute win. https://tenor.com/view/so-this-is-interesting-im-curious-interesting-i-like-it-mysterious-gif-12381778 I could clean it up. The emoji was proposed by a server member and I think it's funny. Also... unrelated but would we be cool with making this an emoji? How about it's just 3 days long... This Thursday, Christmas Eve, and Christmas Day. I was in favor of another Q-n-A, but we can make this one shorter. 👍 Good move. Would the channel re-open afterwards? Does that mean it will log everything that happens on the server? Done I was supposed to unlock this morning, but I got busy. I can answer the last few questions in an hour or two and unlock the server for everybody. Lets do it. I like that idea! https://tenor.com/view/michael-scott-wink-yes-%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%81%E0%A4%96-%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BE-gif-5795910 Monday. Goodnight maties! Family is between order and genus. Well, at least December has a holiday for everyone! Ha ha, no worries. Thursday. Ooo, that could be interesting for a future holiday. it adds interactivity. Nah, it's fun! Cracker for Parrot > 🍪 I'm sure the parrot will appreciate the attention. I'm going to begin **Vacation Mode** on the server tonight (if I can finish my 7 page essay). I'll also upload a small video file in the announcements channel to explain Vacation Mode to the members. I'll delete the ones that look especially bad. I don't like this image. It's way too close to being phallic. Since it is not Zelda, I must respectfully decline. But let him know I appreciate the offer. So, he'd give me a game and I'd do a playthrough of it on my channel? What is 505? The only Game Theory I know is MatPat. Would I know this person? He can DM me directly if he needs me for something. Oh? Honestly people should take a break from Discord on those weeks anyways. Awesome, we're in agreement.  We could probably do it this Thanksgiving Break and the Week of Christmas. Probably not. I would just ignore that. **Fun idea for the server:** Lets shut down all the channels for a week, but keep 1 channel open. The open channel would be a Q&A for members to send questions about the channel. However, members would only be able to send a single message each day.  It might be a nice way to give you guys a break this Holiday.  For some reason the bot forgot. Oh, you mean Dodongo? He just asked me where he wants Changelogs and I told him  Do what? To long; didn't read. Maybe a little antagonistic. This conversation looks like he is trying to be silly, not aggressive. Either way, I didn't see it so I don't want to make a judgement call. I leave that to you  . I don't see any toxicity. Did you delete his posts? Which channel. Oof Spam Ping? Just ban the alt. The original account is fine. Agreed. If they are annoying you can block them. If they were harassing people then don't unmute. That seems much more reasonable. If his DM's are the problem then a 1 week mute is extreme. Just block him. I think we should change it to a 1 day mute again. Wait, really? Did he do anything today on *this* server to break the rules?  It seems like your real problem with Coffee is his DM's. Pfft... 😂 But that doesn't give him an excuse to annoy mods. No... it's not a burn. It's true. He has a mild form of autism. Knowing him personally... he can't. Oh... if that's the problem then block him. How about we mute him for a week. I'm honestly not sure. Hm... Fair penalty. You handled it well Lior Next time someone appeals to me for an unmute, I'll just go with the mod's decision. They told about the same story but thought the spamming was the reason for their mute. No, its too late now. It'd only make him saltier. Sorry about that guys. (you know, maybe I'm not cut out for this discord thing 😅 ) Oh... I'll unmute him now. I talked with Sparrow (who is muted) and they said they didn't know they were spamming. Sparrow's messages kept getting deleted and they assumed it was because of lag. So, they kept posting as we were deleting their messages. Seems like an honest mistake. Thanks for letting me know guys! We can change the rules to include talk about drugs. I'll fix that now. Testing and stuff. This sounds like a fun idea! People will love it. Sure.   Don't ban him. Just tell him the bread pirate thinks he is being a doofus. Me neither. He dm'ed that? I don't think I should say. Oh? Someone is messaging me saying their post was deleted. By the way, did someone delete a post that looked like this? https://discord.com/channels/@me/398208453581209608/896905898872672257 Poodoo. I don't know if there is a timer on bans.  We can ban them for a bit. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  Also, is it a problem we can't bypass mute?  Yes you can mute Coffee. In fact, he's the main reason for it.  We enabled the /tempmute command.  Use it if a user is being a dingus. Seems like it works alright. Alright. Let me try something. We should stick to MEE6 if it has a mute option. It tends to be more stable than the Parrot.  I think Mee6 has a mute feature we could use. Let me check. Do we have a mute feature on this server? Crap. You mean he compared Anti-Semetism to satanism?  Did you get a screen shot of the anti-semetic stuff Riptide said? Riptide probably did it on accident. A warning is fine. Also, why did Discord auto enable threads? That's annoying. I'll fix it now. Thanks for letting me know. Why does blue chu chu have to be like this? Fat can be cute. <:Ginger:795436016801546320> Nice.  This has nothing to do with bands, but I like the cat on your profile picture. It's cute. Is that ginger? Agreed. Most people don't intend to break the rules, they just need a reminder. Fixed Worst Mod! Well that's not going to last long. Yes Good idea Clover. 6 Hours for a channel is WAY too long. 😅  As for myself, I think the only channel which needs a cooldown is memes. Creepy and weird. (and food) If we remove images there will be a riot. People like to upload pets pictures there. Good times. Oh right, I forgot about the Elon Smoke one. Did too many people accuse you of being a beluga impersonator? 😄 Interesting new profile picture  Understandable Darn it, my brother wasn't on. Good. We don't want that floating around. A video you deleted right? I'll talk to them. arctolior? I like this.  (Proceeds to not ask)  Probably cause schools starting and because I haven't made a video in a while. Please don't combust. I like having you around. 🤯 Oi vey. What is up with this guy and Muck. 😵‍💫 Yah, very handy. No no no! 😂 I like that too. I looked it up and found nothing on it. Yah. It's a shame we have to go out of our way to do this. I wish Discord allowed admins to see deleted messages. Well, if you're on PC you can use the "Print Screen" button. It makes an image copy of your PC screen. On phones there is a shortcut for taking screenshots. (I think it depends on the phone)  ^ I have unbanned Watermelon and we are starting a new policy. Before banning someone, take a picture of their rule breaking and put it in the #proof channel. That is indeed the same user, but that's not on this server. 🤔 Watermelon has been a part of the Discord since February. Wait, did you say Watermelon is using alts? Can you DM me some of the words he used so I can add them to a black list? 🤦‍♂️ As for Dan, I have literally no idea what's going on.  I added your description to the channel. It should be good now. Alright, I'll make the gaming channel now. He's talking nonsense. I can't even follow this guy's train of thought. 😂 Interesting idea Yoshi! How about we make a general gaming channel that doubles as a "play with me" channel. Still spamming? Which channel did he do it in this time. He probably knows that already. Next time it happens we will ban. He should know better. https://tenor.com/view/facepalm-the-huxtables-raven-simone-the-cosby-show-gif-9140688  You mean Slurp is at it again? Weird... I'm having connectivity issues so it won't let me kick him.  Could you kick him with this message... "Kicked for excessive spam. It's fine if you want to come back right after the kick, but please don't spam. If you need people to play Muck with then find a Muck server." I just saw the messages he posted. I think a short kick is fair. I'll do it. Ha ha, will do. 😄  Good announcement! Well worded. Just delete it and ask him to "please" not say that again. Vacation was fun. Back. None of that is gonna be on this server. This guy lacks basic human decency if he's posting racist stuff.  Get the hammer. This boi's getting a ban. Yay! Yah and learning should be fun. Stressful environments don't encourage that. Yah, school is geared towards specific type of people. I wish the system were more flexible in that regard. Those grades weren't important anyways. Way to skip a grade. Nice. I have faith in you Lior! You can survive this. 😂 Yay... 🙃  Ha ha, actually Ron, she's graduating from college. That's so exciting. You really deserve it. DANG! Congrats Clover! Oof! That's a long time  Your graduation? Nice to have you aboard Nim! Should we enable it? Also, what is this new "Threads" feature? Sounds conplex, but if you have the time to work on it then by all means you can. back ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ^ Ghost cat Oh dang. We're dropping like flies. 😄 I'm going to camp from Monday till Saturday this week. Me too. Cheese Louis, someone's been going without the Member role for that long? Dyno is fine. It's alright if people randomly try to use commands that don't work.   Don't get lost and have fun! I didn't before, but now I did! Thank you. 🥰 Ah... I see! That sounds handy. (What's a by pass) Better than 'nuthing Sometimes variations of cuss words slip by. Othertimes Dyno goes offline for maintenance. Should be fixed now. Dyno has our blacklist of words. It's the one that deletes cussing. Let me check. They should all be disabled.  I don't see any bot commands in mee6 or Dyno that are available to people.  This is why we pay you. Are they a new setting?   What is this about bot commands? <:Ginger:795436016801546320> Yes, the origin story. Yah, that bug makes reporting confusing. 😅  I'm not worried about Coffee. I don't know if you guys know this already, but he's my cousin. He's a handful in real life too. If he causes anymore problems I'll be sure to ban him. According to the audit log, he just left. I didn't do it. I haven't been able to keep up with the chats. It seems like poop is still adjusting to the rules while Coffee is being annoying as always. Oof. Yah, give the parrot a break. 😂 We don't need blue. I can accept that. Wow! You got that set up super quick. Great work. Okay, that's good. I think it's fine if people want to joke about shipping bread and butter. We can step in if it gets weird.  That's an excellent point Clover.    If you're interested in setting that up it'd clear up a lot of confusion.  When you kicked MoistCoffee did you set a timelimit on how long he'd be kicked? I ought to figure out how to use it. I still haven't learned the commands for it. How could members have ruined something as simple as reactions? I'll put out a general server announcement to address this. Deleting it is fine. Which channel was this in? We have been beanboozled. I checked his twitter account. The creator never said that. Doesn't look like it's real. What? I'm gonna need some sources for that claim. Don't jokes like this die within a month anyways? Even a warning seems like a bit much. Sus doesn't seem that bad. A ban would be way to harsh. Ha ha 😂  They can't be that bad... ...right? 😳   Yah, I can't tell what the situation was either. Sorry I didn't come online yesterday. I was celebrating the 4th with my family. https://tenor.com/view/nervous-sweating-wet-gif-7398449 Godspeed! But now that I think about it, wouldn't it be easier to leave things as they are? Yah know, if it ain't broke don't fix it. Well, if it could use the same message as Mee6 that's be great! It's hard to see so we'll let it slide. Not a bad idea, but seems like a lot of upkeep. Lior be flexing his Moderator might. This one of course! Amen Yoshi! Yah, I've been awful at paying attention to the server, but I plan on being more active. Ouch. Good call. That should work. Kick. Good idea. Pfft... who needs Doom Music when we have this...! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vhIGkVb1Ls It's about time we did that collab Whoa! You're right! Oof ^ Ditto. Probably! But it's alright. 😅 Ayy! Great job.  I didn't know! Good luck with the test.  I'm splurging since it's E3 Week. 😄  Mayterm?  Oh gosh. I have been found. It doesn't have a gross/negative meaning. It's just a saying of "expressing surprise, frustration, or dismay." Yah, heck is fine. We can preserve it for the memories. If it's a natural part of a conversation we can let it pass, but aside from that it's a no-no. Oh, yah that does. Darn. I've been striked. Oof. Roasted by Yoshi. It would have been wacky. Sneaky Peaky: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRqW2x72OVY It would be easier to look up "8 bit frog" It's not 8 Bit, which most of the emotes are supposed to be, but for you guys I'll do it!  Good call. It's going to be a blast Me too! But that will make this summer feel SOOO good. 😄 It's certainly wierd. 😄 Yarg! Way to take initiative. 😄 Interesting... I haven't heard potty humor like this since the 1st grade. I think it's fine this once. Do they usually post weird stuff like this? We dont want to leave those poor people waiting. Great idea! We have defeated spam! Me too! Sure! Sounds like school, but with fewer faces! I love this idea. Some of the suggestions are good. Most are wacky. I agree with this motion. I can be naiive, but I think he's well meaning. I was hoping they were finished with that. 😅 Yes, that should suffice. https://tenor.com/view/alive-dead-im-not-dead-yet-gif-13642579 I didn't do it I do it too. But rarer recently due to college work. You did a great job with it! Ha ha, it's great to see the bot is working. 😄 I prefer 1 Ooo That's a big number Muah! Done  Done! You a captain now  Go ahead! That's your baby. 👶 OBS audio can be cruddy sometimes. Hopefully for the last time. Oi vey. I'll talk to him again. Coffee will keep his one that he got. Oh snap, I forgot to reset Strikes. I'll do that now. Nah, I'm messing. Thanks for covering that. I've been super invested in a script I'm writing and haven't had time to read messages. https://tenor.com/view/bully-theodore-roosevelt-medora-nd-joe-wiegand-happy-gif-14456496 I had a chat with him. It was an accident on his part. ^ What clover said is true.  However, if he's trying to evade it then I'll need to talk with him. I love that Rick's song has a good message. Staying true to the person you love. That's so wholesome. We have a rule about ear rape already. And rickrolls are funny. DM me details. But since it's your video you will have to plan it out. Tell me what you need and I'll do it. This weekend is sort of free for me. Depends on when you want it. I won't be uploading Minecraft on my channel anytime soon, but if you want to invite me to one of your episodes I'd be down for that. Agreed! Yes. He hasn't directly collaborated with me, but I know his channel and talk with him. You are both right. Mods should be chill, but enforce the rules with a light reminder. Moist was a repeated offender so he had it coming. Godspeed Lior! Oh no. 😐  Because he can. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I am sure he'll follow the rules this time. I was talking with him earlier. He'll be back eventually. Ayy, that's neat! Thanks Discord. You were right to do what you did Random. Yes, I know. But it wasn't clear how that applied to memes so I updated it. Moist probably had two strikes. He did a lot of annoying things, but his offenses never seemed bad enough for a ban. It was mostly him sending weird memes and being socially awkward.  It is good that you kicked him instead of a ban. A ban for an annoying meme seems harsh. I will update the rules so that memes like that are dis-allowed. Things are finally slowing down. Nice! If you like punching monsters and listening to rock music. Alas. Poor Slurp. He keeps asking me for advice for his own Discord server. 😅 Very scary. Weird. It says that this message just appeared.  I suggest taking a break and not moderating for a time. Just talk with people, and if you don't want to do that, then just ignore the server for a few days. Yeah, it's fine. It just gives another channel for people to introduce themselves. Preferably that won't happen. It's in the rules now, so if people don't change it when we ask we can give them strikes. I'll ask him again. Wack Weird, but not bad. Goodness! Be nice Random. You don't know where he is coming from. He's probably typing fast. If he types something you don't understand, reply "Could you type clearer?" You can tell us if you want. I think he spammed on accident, but I don't know what else. I'll keep my eye on him. I haven't seen him do anything too bad. Might have been offline. Strange. That word is banned by our bot. How come? Ah! In that case lets leave it as is. If someone cares, then they can change their name. (I'm confused about the pronoun part) (What are Pronoun Reaction roles?) Wha? 1. Maybe someday. 2. Fixed! Preferably, we won't have to ban anyone.  Yah, especially for something as small as "posting in the wrong channel" Lets be a little less strict about strikes. But in the future, don't try to sound menacing. Giving a strike and explaining why is good enough. Ah, very good. Did he do it multiple times after you warned him? Probably didn't need to add "Be careful Buddy" (sounds menacing) But Moist Coffee has been a repeated offender. https://tenor.com/view/what-no-no-no-the-hobbit-pointing-wait-gif-15156638 Thanks Lior! I'm guilty of not doing that. Small PSA: Tell people when they get a Strike in the future. That way they know when they did something wrong. Dang, I didn't even know it had an @ feature. On the other hand, it'd be annoying to monitor when Strikes are given. Good point Yoshi. How about we clear warnings at the beginning of the month without telling members (We don't want them to manipulate that.) That's awesome Oh my word. 😄 I'll pass, but thanks for the offer. From my experience, very few server have a serious "rant" channel, since the word doesn't lend itself to serious discussion. I see two options: 1. Rename Rant -> Vent (And reinforce the serious nature of it) 2. Make a separate channel and call it "Serious" (Only for serious discussion) However, I see some issues with this channel idea. - My channel is pretty silly and attracts people who want to joke around - This server is getting too large for meaningful discussion to take place - The definition of "Serious Discussion" varies from person to person. I am inclined to leave "Rant" the way it is. If you need to vent on something serious then you should reach out to a close friend in DMs (like me). Give me a second to do some research on Rant channels. We can make a new channel for that. 😋 What if Nintendo did something annoying (Ex. Not announce a Zelda game in this Direct) Would that be allowed? You picture it as a serious place on the server then? I'll give him Strike #1 if he doesn't have it yet. No, wait... not those gems. 😂 I don't talk about my playlists much, but there are some hidden gems in there. And I don't think we need to start a contest a day after the server came to life. Everyone already gets access to those. I have playlists for that. A role? I also am skeptical about a "First Week+Booster+Trusted" Channel. Neat idea, but I don't want to put that on my videos. I AM INEVITABLE!  I concur. It's not the same, but that is bound to happen when we have new members added.  Even before, the server was constantly changing how it felt when new members joined.  Thanks Random. Tell him to stop, and if he does it again give him a Strike. Yes (JK, i just wanted to say the same thing Lag did. 😋 ) Good Be nice. It has been removed. Yah, I did that since it's repetitive. oof In Media channels? Yes. In general? No Thanks for getting it back up Lior! I suppose that works, but what if I want to help with a problem? Wait... why wouldn't I know about it! Co-Captain. 😄 Rules! Whatever you're doing with the bot, it's great.  This chat was a roller coaster of emotions. 😄 Holy Carp... <:Fishy:722164604595077253>  That got a lot of reactions fast. I hope the channel likes it too. Thanks! Thought you guys should see it first since you've all been so helpful. I made a thing...  https://youtu.be/75CvTctzv_4 Ouch, sorry about that. Oof. I feel that. As long as you think it's going well. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  Any updates on the bot today! 😃 "Pineapple Pizza isn't THAT bad." Time to say something controversial so they all unsub! 😄 Just bot stuff. Yes. That is correct Tax. "...and e" - Lior 2021 Not yet. I want to see how it pans out.  Don't feel rushed. Not until Lior is finished with the bot. Have patience. No And if this new system doesn't work then we'll fix it as we go. The server can be flexible. I won't change the media ones either. (Opps, and Promo) (0 in all others) (30 second cooldown in server suggestions ) We have a bot that filters spam already.  Lets start without cooldowns and add them as necessary. Not possible. 5 secs is the minimum But speculation =/= theories. Maybe Mee6 can help. Sadly the minimum is 5 seconds. I'll think about removing the limit later. Hmm... good point. I agree with Ron. We don't need that many suggestions. Yes.  Alright, you've been promoted. JK. I'll fix that in a minute. Demoted. 😂 I like it. 🤔 Nice call. No idea who renamed Media but thanks. Let me know afterwards if it looks weird. Nice. I'll take that as a yes. Thoughts? I'm considering re-arranging the server so that "Text Channels" (General/Zelda/Speculation) are separate from "Sharing Channels" (Art/Images/Music/Bread) Then we can open this afternoon. No thanks. People can go to the channel for that. "Eating crackers" Easier idea. **Image Spam Protection** - If 6 images are sent in a 1 minute period it will delete further images for the next few minutes (5 minutes) Lets just focus on reporting. Then don't worry about that feature. Is that too complex for a bot? (In all other channels, you must be present for 36 hours before sending images) Yes, and art Yes, I made stupid while typing. Cool, so we have two features so far. -Report -Reaction Roles -Prevent Images for a specific time Lior knows best in this regard. Alright, we'll allow text in pictures and art then. (Aka deleting non-images) **Question** Should Images and Art be image only channels? I veto a leveling system. It also can encourage spam. Sorry, I was messing around with MEE6 Crap So kinda. We also would like reaction roles. The big thing we need is the report feature. Oh dang. Yah. (edited to 36) Preventing people from posting images until they've joined for 36 hours. Report feature I don't know anything about commands, but I know that we're using a ? This is something we can look towards in the coming months, but right now we should focus on just getting the server open again.  How is the bot going? Do you need anything from me? Ayy! Interesting idea. We'll consider implementing that in the future. Yes. I'll add that now. I have school, but I enjoy it. Whoa! Nice.  I have a bad feeling about allowing swearing at all. So we will not do that. But a rant channel could work. No worries! I think we're almost ready to open tomorrow. I'll think about it Eh... Agreed yes Also, i'd like to make some more channels. Just a few. The bot. Oh No, it has more. Look in the rules channel No worries, school is more important. I suppose I only need to meet with Lior to work on the bot. I failed you all. 😂 I meant 4:30 est. I have to get dinner, but I can come back later. Whoops. My bad. 😅 Alright, I overhauled the rules. Let me know if I missed anything. I'll edit more channels later today. I have another meeting to get to, so I'll see yall later! That's fine. Lets just consider this a "casual get-together to talk if you have time" Poor Ginger. 😄 Sweet! In other news, I'm almost finished replying to all the comments before the Apology video. I just have a few long ones to finish. Alright then. I'll be in VC and work on polishing the server. If you can't meet then we'll just push the server's opening until Wednesday. The mod meeting at 4 will need to be pushed back to 4:30 It's only a half hour of time, but it should be enough to hammer out the final touches. Sorry Random. 😋 Don't bother DMing people. I set Mee6 to do it automatically now. That was just bad luck. It'll get better. JK We can change that! 😂 And that was in an entire year Only 2 bans from what I remember. It'll be fine. One step at a time. So many at once. Cheesy Louise. Make a new message for that. It'll be your playground of sorts. Yes. Sounds... tedious. What? No one could have seen that coming. Ha ha, not quite. It's my fault I promised it. It's an apology video about not being able to keep up with comments. The video that is.  Ahh... it's a bit late to change it now. 😅 That works Yes. I can be there in a bit.  I'd like to have a chat with anyone available in a few minutes about how we should improve the server for the larger size.  That's fine. https://tenor.com/view/good-evil-star-wars-emporer-palpatine-darkside-gif-4624104 Alright. In the meantime I'll shut things down.  Wait for the VC Here's the video going out in a few minutes. https://youtu.be/MAzKK9VAhnA I can VC in a bit. I need the dash. No, I use that in conversation a lot to make lists. Then we can use ? Can't we re-use / That's fine, we're all a little busy right now. Problem solved. 😄 We'll start the shutdown tomorrow. We might shut it down longer if needed. When we call we can make a list.  Let call em, "The Parrot" Use this as profile picture... 🦜 Features can be in a bit. Not sure what you were asking. Also, i'm going to invite Ron I can get on this afternoon in about 2 hours. Yes. No one will be kicked, we will just hide all the channels. I will be making a short unlisted video to explain the situation. Then we will shut it down. I want to shut down the server for a day. We can re-write the rules and roles. Then re-open. We need an overhaul on this server. I still have classes going on so remind me later today. But make it a 24 hour kick. Kick, not ban yet. I like that idea. We are deleting the Creator Role soon, so don't worry about giving it out. It's getting a refresh. I leave the banning in your guy's hands. I trust your judgements. Dang. This man is asking for a kick. He already had 1? You can do it. Do you need admin privls?  I'm going to a class in 7 minutes. How about tonight? Long time no see. 😋 That's a lot We could even VC if you want! I'm tired tonight. Remind me tomorrow. Perhaps. We could scrap the role and start it over. Not yet. But in the future. Ooo! That sounds simple enough. Perhaps ONLY Zelda content creators, or only people who reach the threshold of 500. I like the idea of entering it through a bot. Is that possible? We will let it go through this time, but in the future I'll add more strict guidelines for the creator role. (Yoshi: Proceeds to throw Mutiny.) https://tenor.com/view/wolf-of-wall-street-jordan-belfort-leonardo-di-caprio-one-of-us-jonah-hill-gif-5441859 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ If it was a repeated offense, then yes, they would be demoted. It all depends. Bribe for what? Just don't take the bribe. Are you asking about what happens if you're bribed? Indeed we are!  Don't be afraid to correct people for disobeying the rules. But dont give the Warning Role unless they do things maliciously. - Ron - Yoshi What the heck, why didn't I think of Yoshi. He's active and respectful. He isn't very active. I love coffee, he's related to me, but he's not a mod. No. Dear lord. Ron is also next in line. I think he's a fine pick. Hm... I'll still consider him, but as a last resort then. How old is he? He's been here a long time and has been very active. Goose especially. That is not needed, but thanks for the suggestion. I think the clear candidates for this role will be apparent without counting each users message numbers. Good call. I have a suspicion that some of them are inactive now, but anyone who's still active should get that promotion. We should convene and think about who would be best qualified. At the present moment a lot of the people on the server are a bit young for the position so it'll be difficult. I think we should hire another mod, or two. It's fixed. Yah! There we go. Actually, heck. Lets call it "First Week Somthing something..." I'll add the sub part to the title Pre-350 Subs This makes fun of gross people. I approve. Good move! Agreed. Lior is right. I can edit the rules. Yo yo? Exactly! Big channel is fine, but a small server is what I want. You jobs are still the same. Smile and wave. Most new comers seem super nice. I will NOT be advertising the Discord in any videos, but I will leave it at the top of video Descriptions.  I'd like it if this place stayed smallish. Ha ha, thank you Tax. 😊 I anticipated for this spike to slow down sooner, but it has not. Hence! We should brace ourselves for more Discord activity in the coming month. So, I have put together a little presentation explaining out current situation. Ahoy Mods! It is. But I control it. What do you need? Ha! Then you have my blessing. We need you. No. Ha ha! You mean the alt? Wait a minute. . . 🤔 Oh. Neat. Why? I can't help you with this one. It's not my style of music so I don't know if it's worth using. For now the emote will be "butter". Short for butterscotch <:Ginger:795435508993490974> I remember 1 person. But my memory is floppy Idunno. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ But I'm sure the algorithm will bless our channel. https://tenor.com/view/ban-banned-gif-8540509 I sure hope so! Otherwise we'll dust off our ban hammers. Thanks for staying around mods, and here's to a fantastic New Year! I'm 80% certain botw2 is happening this year, so things are gonna get PACKED fast. Yarg. Good call. 😅 I suppose some of you have only been mods for a few months, but the server is at least 6 months old, right? Thanks Lior! And Merry Christmas guys.  Cheers to keeping the server from sinking for a whole 6 months! Don't sink the ship. :D You are now a temporary captain! Sure! Let's do it.  I'm going to be in five minutes, but I can give you the privileges you need. Oh! Thanks for explaining.  I don't understand Discord communities. It seems like an weird step to unlock features. :thinking: I don't see a point in splitting our already small community. When we get to 500k subs I'll consider it. 😄 Two servers? Seems like a lot to keep track of. 😖 I click a button and it happens, but it also makes our server public to join. Not sure how I feel about it. Maybe in the future we can do it. No. 😦 Pretty cool! We should look into this. Nice! Ah, that makes sense. I suppose I'm guilty of that too. That's a bit confusing. If you have a preference for one of them, then why do you need people to vote? Did you vote for 1? Good luck editing! Ahhh... For what? Nah, let's make a totalitarian regime! (Obviously, we all think of the term "family friendly" differently, so use your best judgement.) I'm pretty lenient with memes on this server, but if you see something that violates the family friendly part of our server then delete it. Ew... That's not good. Did you delete it? Ayy! Then Wisconsin is the place for you! That's a scary place. I hear they have zombies there. Have fun! Where are you going? He was fairly active when it was given out. But you might be right. Let's not take it away just yet. Perhaps he's been busy.  Nothing. I don't think. 🤔 By the way, I'm at my grandma's so Im going afk soon. Especially you.  I like all of you guys Nah, y'all are fine. Get outta here! You're not allowed in here. What the... They are all great songs, but in different ways. If I was editing a video, I would use 1. It has a clearer melody especially at the 1 Minute mark which would work well. The others can work to, but seem more challenging. There's no rush to decide on the intro. I won't be making a video until close to Thanksgiving since my HW assignments are so long. There's a 14 page paper that has me especially scared. __Votes__ Corners = 1 Borders = 2 Nothing = 4 (I changed my vote and one other person added a vote to bordered.) The animation still doesn't line up with the music, but if you're not a perfectionist then leave it. You could fade it out at 6 seconds. Well, if you the animation in the second can't be changed, then go with the first one, but shorten it. The Animation is better synced with the first one, but the music in the second one is nice. A bit long, but really professional! I love it. I rated each one separately. The first one has a backwards hand. 7/10 5/10 Nothing has 2 votes now, but borders has already gotten 3. Sorry guys, but I'm considering votes from people outside this chat as well. I will add my vote as well. Try Barker? Oh, tie breaker. 😄 Noted. Corners = 1 Borders = 3 Nothing = 3 Corners? Borders? Or nothing? I got talking with another Zeltuber (Legend Zone, he's a great guy) and he gave a few suggestions on the intro. https://tenor.com/view/agreed-will-ferrell-anchorman-gif-5016662 I have to agree. I want an intro that is short and to the point. Have fun! Valid point. Noted! Tax doesn't think the smashing sound adds anything. That way I can take your suggestion into consideration! Why do you like that one better? Noted. You mean the one with the box crash? Which one is the first one? Just came back from a talk with my art direction manager. We got a new intro idea. Small changes. Yah... about that... https://tenor.com/view/undecided-confused-well-i-dont-know-uhm-gif-4970805 I'll pin this so that it can be found easier. Thankfully we added the new rule. No we will never see grossness again! We were joking.  We know it wasn't the dog. 😄 Wait- err, I mean. We are adding rule #9 We are banning hot dogs. It is settled then. 9️⃣ Don't post any gross content or anything with gore (Ex. Overtly sexual content, food while it is being chewed, gore) We need to be more concrete. Give me a minute. Grrr, you're right. bet gray? Alright, new rule. 9️⃣ Don't be gross. So offensive! I didn't see it, but Clover and Lior took care of it. Were talking about the deleting of a gif from a while back. I'll add a rule to cover future situations like this. It's nasty if nothing else. I didn't see it, but I heard that happened. I believe it was someone showing chewed food in their mouth. Right? I didn't see it, but I trust your judgement.   Thanks for dealing with the inappropriate gif. Sure. Just pretend it stands for something different. He's just a rat. He doesn't do much. Let's go! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Darn. That was a conveniently named can. Trials begin this weekend and will be attended by Members of the discord for their viewing pleasure.  Congrats! You're now officially mods!  With the mod rank you now have the ability to edit channels and delete messages.  If you want to edit a channel, or add/delete a channel, let me know first. I trust you guys won't abuse the privilege.  😋 You've been a Mini-Mod for the soul purpose of becoming a mod. 😅 Yes sir! I'm busy right now though, so it'll be in this afternoon that we do it. Feel free to ask me if you have any other ideas for Roles in the future. https://tenor.com/view/yogscast-simon-honeydew-case-closed-gif-17138799 Then the job of the W Gang role is already fulfilled by the "W" in each of your titles. So the rank would be a way of identifying members? And what does the W Gang do? You're not selling me on the purpose of this rank. Sounds like a glorified "Member +" rank. Are you saying that anyone with W in their name is included? Hmm, seems sketchy. Are you in the gang? How do you decide who's in the Gang? Nah, I'm messing. I just want to know what purpose the role would server and how it would be given out. https://tenor.com/view/oprah-veto-fantasy-football-happy-smile-gif-12582421 V for Vetoed. More like V What is the W Gang about? Yah, I'll get the role made Huh, I'll need to test this. You can just mute players can't you? Hopefully you'll never need to. Can't kick/ban yet! 😄 You guys were chosen because you each excelled at something.  Lior = Technical Expertise/Experience Tax = Consistently Active/Good Character Clover = Mature/Level-Headed If you have any other questions you can DM me or ask me in here. For instance, Lior, if you want to talk about adding server bots we can explore that this weekend. Thanks for being patient! I recently got a new job so I'm a little frazzled at the moment. 😖  As Mods your job is pretty simple. 1. Interact with the community as you always have done. 2. Help people when they aren't aware of a rule. 3. Under rare circumstances give out a warning role 4. Under even rarer circumstances kick someone. (This shouldn't happen unless it's clearly a server troll or a raid.) 5. If someone is posting NSFW content everywhere, cussing, and attacking other members feel free to ban them. We have only ever had 1 ban though, so ideally you should never have to do this. You all have the ability to assign roles to other members now. So if someone wants the *creator* role you can give them that so long as they meet the criteria (ignore the quality part though, I only added that to discourage effortless content creators). 🎞 This also means that you can assign the **Warning** roles. There are Major warnings and Minor Warnings. 🛑  Two Minors = Kick Two Majors = Ban The Rules:*"If you do not follow the rules you will be given "Warnings" in the form of a new role. Minor offenses (Ex. Spam) can lead to a server kick. Major offenses (Ex. Insults, Nudity and Swearing) will lead to a permanent ban."* As moderators you are not overlords, you're public servants. I made the mistake of being a tyrant in the first few weeks of this server and I would hate to see the same happen on the moderator level.  If someone is new to the server, don't give them warning roles when they break the rules. They probably just missed a rule, or are not used to Discord.  Be lenient with justice. We have firm rules, but we are also welcoming. So if someone accidentally swears, give them a pass. Consider if the act was malicious before going **BAN HAMMER MODE** on them. I don't think I have much more to say except thank you! Done. Congratulations guys, and thanks for being willing to help out! Also, I'm stupid busy today, so I won't be able to give you guys a run-down on server responsibilities until this evening. (EST) Like I said in most of the interviews, yall are starting with the Mini-Mod role, and then after a week we'll get you full mod privilege.  Honestly, Mini-Mods have almost full Mod powers, but I like the way "Mini-Mod" sounds so we might as well do it this way. Welcome to the Captain's Quarters! This is the Mod/Admin chat on the server. We don't use it all that often (thankfully) but if an emergency ever came up this is where we'd discuss it. Oh, that's super handy! Thanks for teaching me this stuff. What's the difference? Aren't all posts in the Announcement's channel "published?" What about when I make a server announcement? Um... Oh... That works WAY better for me. Done Do we NEED to have the New Videos channel? Yup! No idea what it means. But it is done. Wait? Oh, yah. I don't know if I want to give that out. But Channel Privileges are fine. You have been blessed with Din's Flame. Well, I'll still give you the privileges! Oh... poop. But I can't guarantee I'll keep it. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ > itll look better when i do it I can do it after my class. So I'll be available in an hour. You know, now that I think about it, the  role is a bit repetative. I'm probably gonna have to get rid of it soon. Would the channel have to be public? I kind of like the system we have going already in the announcement's channel on this server. But wouldn't it be easier to just post a link in the announcements channel everytime there's a new video? https://tenor.com/view/calculating-puzzled-math-confused-confused-look-gif-14677181 Nevermind, looks like it can't be changed. I'll need to change that if it's true. Fair enough. But wasn't that in the SPAM Channel? /rank Scout /rank Scout I think that will do nicely. /rank cook /rank Scout /rank Cannoneer test https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/722086066596741147/738086509013630986/Samus_is_Serious.gif Oh! Ha ha, it wouldn't work quiet like that. 😅  Are you open to VC right now? I haven't heard from you in quiet some time. Really? What's your thoughts on it? Alright. People want more ranks on our server, but I don't want to use an XP system. It only promotes spam. Here's my plan... Give members roles when they React to a certain bot message. We can start simple with only 3 possible reactions and then add more later. The three possible roles members can get should be thematic I believe. (Cannoneer, Scout, Cook) (Hylian, Zora, Goron) Thoughts? Suggestions? If it weren't for some graduation parties I'm going to today I would have streamed. Me too. Need what? If you do want to play a game together, I always have Minecraft! I've been considering Youtube livestreaming recently. You're right. I really should. I'm sure it was a legendary battle! Ah, I see. I'll bet it was Diddy Kong Oh. Who beat you? There we go. I like "Shrip" good idea. I know. I just want to mess with them as well. 😄 I like having them together with the mods. It makes things look less cluttered. Technically they already do. Each bot has its own role as well as the mod role. <:Octo:735201277973364808> <:Spam:732992447642206290> Couldn't the  announcements channel double as a poll channel? I'm skeptical, but I'd like to see what some other people think. You might be onto something with this spam channel idea. See, I still don't understand that. What do people find fun about a spam channel? 🤔 I've been juggling with the idea for a while, but I can't find a good reason for having one. What do you think? <:mad:730068988301803530> Speaking of which, this reminds me that I'd like to adjust the rules slightly to better explain a few things. Should be a minor change. Exactly! It all depends on context. Thanks for deleting that! I didn't blacklist the word "hell" since it can refer to the place, but if it's being used to cuss then that's a no-no. The only exception is if someone says "bloody hell" since that's a common phrase in British. "family friendly" emote That's a good idea! I'll do research into that later today. <:Vivi:723571545116508220> <:happy:725779401031024641> <:HappySalesman:725771104412631070> Cool, they work <:sub:725422469027987507> <:oldman:725422163242385518> Ha, I was just testing out the emotes.

Tomorrow I'll work out a system that is more efficient. Great minds think alike. :d Yes No, Grammer Soviet *commune Glory to the state! Cool. This will help scare the infidels into believing we have a legitimate Moderation team. 😉 What about it? You won't be obligated to moderate stuff, it's just that I trust you with them. You want Moderator Privileges? I knew I shouldn't have trusted you. NO! How could you. It's in here  Welcome to the quarter! 🍞 **NEW VIDEO (and it's a Long One!)** https://youtu.be/PXWKQGvCpqk @everyone Made a meme.

I'm going to do something **WEIRD** with the channel. ⏩ **TLDR:** I'm uploading 3 short videos instead of 1 big one. 📆  **When:** This week, but if it works we might do it again. 🤔  **Why:** Many Zeltubers have a reserve of ideas that are too small for an 8-10 Minute video. When this happens, they combine 5 ideas into one video, that way it reaches the "appropriate" length...  BUT! I have a theory! I think making smaller videos will boost their quality, make them easier to watch (cause they're shorter), and faster to produce.  Do yall remember that video I did about "What happens when a monster eats food?" I could have answered that question in 60 seconds, but I turned it into a SIX MINUTE VIDEO! What the heck was I thinking? That's not respectful of the viewer's time. I want to be straightforward with yall. 😅   So that is why, we're doing something *adventurous*! Most viewers will be confused, but you are different. Me and you... we are in the loop. 🎗️  That is all! Have a nice day and *have fun storming the castle!* @everyone New video! And we got  join. @everyone 😄 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hxcbaNqvs&lc=UgxW8M644rDJd-256h14AaABAg @everyone I am back from college! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GH5u33dfTI Quick reminder!

You know what I mean? *"Oh my gosh guys! Thanks so much for 1,000 subs! I never thought I'd make it this far. Lets get to 2,000 next year!"* THAT IS WEAK SAUCE! We don't *hope* for 1,000 Subs, we KNOW we will! Heck, we could get WAY higher than 1,000. We got guts, confidence, and bread! 🍞  The two largest Zeltubers I know are Zeltik (468K subs) and ZeldaMaster (507K subs). If they could do it, so can we!

Still, I would like to thank everyone who congratulated me on 600 Subscribers. 🥰  Little did you know, there were TWO milestones this week. Today the channel hit 50,000 views! (5,320 of which are mine) That's larger than the population of Monaco! (The small City-State on the south coast of France) 🇲🇨  Have a nice day everyone. I'm going to do homework now. 📜 **Announcement #43: Does Food HEAL Enemies...?** 🍌 @everyone  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xraFrzHZjZI&feature=youtu.be <:Heart:742212343114629170> **Announcement #42: Intro and Change?** @everyone <:Heart:742212343114629170>  Ahoy Gents! (And Gants? What the heck is the female variant of gent?) A Youtube channel is nothing without it's community, so I want to let you know what I am thinking.     1️⃣  I __do not__ have a Switch, so I cannot play Age of Calamity. Yet, Age of Calamity is going to overshadow BotW videos for months.     2️⃣  I'm curious about making new types of videos, but I still love talking about the ways Zelda could be improved.     3️⃣  I am going to be doing that Bread% speedrun eventually. This doesn't influences the channel, but I wanted to announce it officially.      4️⃣ I would like to do a Wind Waker series soon. This could give me a break from making edit heavy videos, which is awesome.     5️⃣ The channel is still young. This is a time of *experimentation*! 🧪 And that's good! It means that we can find our niche on Youtube and improve the channel. That is why I have edited the channel logo, intro, and banner. I want to find ways to polish the channel before I commit to a style. Speaking of new intros, here are our rough drafts! (Possibly final drafts.) Thanks again for being wonderful people. You're all a pleasure to be with and talk too. **Announcement #41: Extra Life Charity Stream**  @everyone  Ahoy maties!  My good friend, Jeremy King, is doing a 24-Hour charity stream! It's for the Children's Miracle Network Hospital.  https://www.twitch.tv/jeremykingtech As always, thanks for the support and I'll hope to hear from many of you soon. Announcement #40: To Kill An Introduction @everyone  <:mad:730068988301803530>  After much thinking in the shower and researching of analytics I decided that we are going to discontinue the "Table Smack" intro for analysis videos. I know what you're thinking...  *"How on earth are we suppose to watch your content now!* *What the heck is a table-smack intro?* *Why are you @ing me?* Do not worry! The content of the videos will remain unchanged. It's just the intro with the flash-cards and doodles that is going away. This **only** affects Fixing BotW videos. I am unsure what will replace the table-smack intro. Maybe nothing! We will see. Here is a graph explaining why this change is going into effect. Download ink for people who can't access the video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yYMAvi7DGuIFSCv_UzVAkGXxTlSiExc1/view?usp=sharing **Announcement #39: Guns in Zelda? 🔫 @everyone ** Well, I never thought this would happen!

And have fun storming the castle. 🏰 **Announcement #34: Baby Stream** <:happy:725779401031024641>  @everyone  *Refer to previous announcement for more information. **Announcement #33: Finishing A Link to the Past (I think)** 😅 <:Vivi:723571545116508220> @everyone  I'm going to be playing A Link to the Past in #Game Chat 1 at 2:00 PM (EST) tomorrow. Feel free to watch, talk, or text in . I only have 3 Dungeons left! 🛑 **Announcement #32: Politics Rules Update** 🛑  @everyone  Since we started this server, Rule #7 said that politics and world events are allowed. This rule has been updated! You can still talk about politics, but you can't make fun of other people's suffering. That's just messed up and we want this to be a wholesome server.  Cool, I think that's everything. Happy October ya'll! 🎃 **Announcement #31: Minecraft Joins Smash Bros?** 🌳  Um... I'm not a big Smash Bros player, but I think that this is cool. 😋 **Announcement #30: Fixing Durability** 🔨 @everyone  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTDwmIcOqs&feature=youtu.be **Announcement #29.5: New Banner (Elic Wins!)** <:Drink:742212331228102657>  Last announcement today.

The people on this server are really talented!  made a new server logo for us now that we are boosted. Thanks again boss. 😍  Make sure to check it out! It's animated. Ideal banner size = 1920x1080 ^ This is just a pretty map. It's what I use for the Youtube channel banner too. **Announcement #26: Banner Contest <:Chu:723608915677413467> ** @everyone  If it was up to me I'd use the Zelda 2 map and call it a day... BUT the people have spoken and we're going to be having a banner contest now that we've been boosted (Thanks Ivan & Elic)!  The competition will go from This Friday to Next Friday (Submissions end at Midnight). And after we (The Captain) go through them all we'll pick a winner and add them to the banner! **Encouraged Themes:** Pixel Zelda (Zelda 1, Zelda 2, and A Link to the Past are preferable styles for the nostalgia 😋), Pirate Zelda, or Doodle Zelda (AKA, the art style of the original Zelda Instruction Manual). **Colors:** Not required, but the maroon color from the Server logo is encouraged so that we can have a matching theme. (If you have a better color scheme for a banner then be creative! Maroon is just to help you get started if you don't know what to do.) Directly Message me () to submit your banner! Here are some images that might help you... **Announcement #25: Boosts?** @everyone  I don't know what the heck a boost is, but we have one and it's perfect. Thanks  and  **Announcement #24: Moment of Truth!**  <:sub:725422469027987507>  @everyone  Me and Vivi (<:Vivi:723571545116508220>) put a ton of work this week and we're happy to share the finished product!  Right now the video is a bit of a secret, but it's going to be public tomorrow at 12:00 (EST). Thanks to everyone on the server who helped along the way! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opq7EwavHqA&feature=youtu.be@everyone Hopefully it'll be up this Sunday. I don't know how many times my software crashed, but it's finally finished! We're a little bit past halfway now! And I think the second half will be easier than the first half. I gotta quit using so many stinkin' elements on these videos! <:happy:725779401031024641> It's not major news, but here's more progress on the video. 6.5 Minutes/16 Minutes **Announcement #23: New Zelda Game: Hyrule Warriors** <:Get:738511046381142027>  @everyone  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifm8tpcO4vw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDMWRRAEogs&t=5s **Announcement #500.1: Progress <:Vivi:723571545116508220> ** @everyone  With some help from Vivi (the fairy) we managed to finish the first third of THE video. So here's a rough draft of what we have... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-YMtGmZl18 **Announcement #500: YOU WIN!!** We just made it to 500 Subscribers on the channel, so we're celebrating with a Stanley Parable Meme. @everyone  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6deX8UFOYsM&feature=youtu.be **Announcement #21: Steady Progress <:oldman:725422163242385518> ** @everyone  I am almost finished with my first week of classes and editing has now started on the Compare/Contrast Video!  *(Not that most people probably care. I know I would not! In fact, if I were in your position I would have a lot of better things to do than sitting at a computer screen reading about a Youtuber's uploading schedule. Don't you have like a job or something? At the very least you probably have a Youtube series to get caught up with... SERIOUSLY! Why are you doing reading this? It's not even part of the announcement. This is just me rambling about how people's priorities are messed up. Go out and do something with your life.)* In order to make sure I don't overwork myself or (worse yet) forget to work on the project, I am scheduling an hour out of each day to get a little bit done.  Here's what we have so far. And thanks for sticking with the channel! **Announcement #20: I'm at College** 🏫  I am at college. If anyone cares. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNCYU4dpaQQ&feature=youtu.be @everyone **Announcement #19: Quick Memo** <:Vivi:723571545116508220>  **1.** We removed @NotificationCrew. In hindsight the role was repetitive since @everyone is just as effective. **2.** I'm going back to college tomorrow! Once I'm settled down/un-packed we will be having another "baby-stream" on Discord. **3.** I am stalling on making videos because...      a) Minecraft is addicting.      b) I am burnt out from making weekly videos this summer.      I will be working on videos again soon. In the meantime, here's a puppy! Thanks to all that joined! We suffered through technical difficulties, giant worms, and a lot of game overs, but over all I think it went well. 😋 @everyone **Announcement #18: Master Sword Livestream** We're starting in an hour! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tTlkk8O-cA&feature=youtu.be Announcement #17: YOUTUBE STREAM <:Drink:742212331228102657>  We're streaming A Link to the Past this Friday at 2 PM (EST).  Have fun storming the castle!  @everyone **Announcement #16.2: NO Highlights Video**  😓   @everyone  I tried to edit the stream video into a Highlight's reel, but I could not find a way to make it work. Most of the stream centered on the interaction between the comment's section and myself. And, while it's fun to be a part of that interaction, it doesn't work as a Let's Play.  Sorry for breaking my promise to you guys. I'll try to be better too you all in the future.  **In other news...** ... I WILL be making the live stream public later today. ... I am going to be focusing my efforts on research for a new video which I am *thinking* of making. (A Compare and Contrast of the NES Legend of Zelda with Breath of the Wild) ... I want to stream again **this coming weekend.** (TBA) Have fun storming the castle. 🏰 Announcements #16.1: Conclusion @everyone Thank you so much to everyone that joined! It was a blast being able to play the game with my favorite crew. <:happy:725779401031024641>  I archived the stream in a playlist and will be making a Youtube video for it soon.  Godspeed maties! **Announcement #16: A Link to the Past! Stream Starts in 30 Minutes!** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flanLRcnVKE&feature=youtu.be **Announcement #15: New Roles!** <:Sword2:723962669203193897>  @everyone We've had a busy week on the server haven't we? In celebration for our Live-Stream on Friday we have created **3 New Roles!** (Get it! Cause it's episode 3 of the Series?) The Cannoneer, The Scout, and The Cook! 👨‍🍳 (Look at our updated Rules for information on how to get them.) As a final note, thank you to   &  for helping with the stream thumbnail in the general chat. <:happy:725779401031024641> Announcement #14: Thumbnail Poll (For Friday's Stream at 2PM EST) Which is better?  Left = <:Chu:723608915677413467>                        Right = <:Octo:735201277973364808>  @everyone Hope to see you all there! <:Vivi:723571545116508220> Secondly! We are livestreaming episode 3 this Friday at 2 PM! (EST)  (Here is a timezone converter: https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/) Announcement #13: Livestream  🔴   First off, here is episode 2... https://youtu.be/ip5grku0YMQ Announcement #12: New Series!    <:Sword2:723962669203193897>                               <:Get:738511046381142027>  **A Link to the Past** will be going public this Friday!  I have no idea how far we will get into the game, but it's gonna be a blast. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cM3XoaOV82Q&t=1s Announcement #11: Welcome to the Shimp! ?⛵?🦐 ? At the bequest of our moderator, Speedrun "RGNX" Pirate, we have changed the server's name.   Thank you for the suggestion! (Not sure how long I'll keep it this way 😋 ) Announcement #10: Busy Enemies Shhhh! It's a secret to everybody. <:happy:725779401031024641>  Tomorrow I'll make it public on Youtube, but you can see it now if you'd like. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrnP7qeBsFc&feature=youtu.be **Announcement #9: Friendly Enemies** <:Chu:723608915677413467>  https://youtu.be/r94HDuJgg9o P.S. I suggest you all mute spam. <:mad:730068988301803530> **Announcement #8: Spam Channel** Against my better judgement, but by popular request, we now have a SPAM CHANNEL! <:happy:725779401031024641>  (Just don't post anything nasty.) ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ In other news, I did not post a video this week. Truth be told, I've been pretty tired and I have a job starting in less than a week. So, I am concocting ways to keep making weekly videos without spending 12 hours of my time making them. 😅  I still want to make an "A Link to the Past" series, but I'm having a hard time getting in the right mood. Anyday now. Have fun storming the castle! @everyone <:Shwing:729912223044075611> **Announcement#7: I'm Back!** <:Vivi:723571545116508220>  Ahoy! I'm back from vacation and ready to lay the ban hammer down. 🔨 😈   (JK) I wanted to let you know that the rules have been adjusted slightly. The biggest change is that we now differentiate between Major and Minor offenses. Also, the "pictures" channel has been expanded to be "pictures-video." ~~~ Outside of server news, the next gaming series will be on "A Link to the Past"! I don't know if it will be a full run-through, or just a mini-series, but it should be fun. Enjoy the new emote. https://youtu.be/_-HAA8v-wqE **Announcement #6.1: Vacation** 🏖️  I am going away until the 6th of July! @everyone  I will still check in on this Discord, but my response time to messages on Discord and comments on Youtube will be much slower than normal. Thankfully I managed to finish two videos in a single week! So next Friday will be the finale to, "Zelda Mods Destroyed Me and My Brother's Relationship." Here is a sneak peak of the thumbnail... **Announcement #6: Collaboration with RGNX** **Random_Gamer_NX** and me did a collaboration about dungeons! <:oldman:725422163242385518>  It's premiering in 10 Minutes on his channel. I highly recommend joining us for our little podcast. 😄  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixz1qlM7gbE Discord Stream in 5 minutes! <:Octo:726143202436055081>  Announcement #5.1: New Role & Octodad There is a new role you can get in the Rules Channel! Behold, the *Notification Crew!* Whenever I get ready to stream or I post a new video, I will __only__ ping people with this role. That way I don't need to @everyone all the time. 😉  Also, I'm going to be streaming Octodad on this Discord server in about a half an hour. I'll be responding to messages in the  chat if you have anything you want to say. 🐙  Hope to see yah there! **Announcement #5: Fixing Stables**  Buckle up your saddle! We got another video for all y'all cowboys and girls. Today we're tackling the Stable System in BotW2. 🐴  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXJarGqN-YQ&feature=youtu.be **Announcement #4: Rejected Clip** I'm editing episode 3 of "Zelda Mods Destroyed Me and My Brother's Relationship" and wanted to show off a clip that didn't fit into the finished product. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBkEByX4Mm0&feature=youtu.be @everyone Stream starting in a minute. **Announcement #3: Discord Stream** I've never done a livestream before, but I'd love to try it!  In ONE HOUR I'll be livestreaming Terraria in the "Stream Games" Voice Chat.  Hope to see some of you there! <:Vivi:723571545116508220>  @everyone **Announcement #2** Thank you everyone for joining our little corner of the Internet!  From this point forward there will be a 10 minute wait before you can chat on the server. This is to prevent Raids and to ensure that people read the rules. I'm not a professional at running a server so forgive me if things are a bit messy at the moment. We will add channels/roles as needed. @everyone @everyone  We have a pictures channel. I hope that keeps you all from throwing a revolution. **Announcement #1** Here is the new video coming out this Friday. I am announcing the Discord server in the video. https://youtu.be/RRhNbFmMtEI Or did they leave already an I am oblivious. :O Looks like they just left today. I love that you can reach the towers.  That is really cool. :D Whoa. That's like... Super duper dedication. https://c.tenor.com/ihqN6a3iiYEAAAAM/pikachu-shocked-face-stunned.gif Yes! Assassin's Creed taught me that Haybales fix everything. Hopefully there was a haybale on the street to break his fall. 😬 I am indeed shooting them. Yup. I am shooting nuts. Hi Okay. I think I have had enough time to process this. This is a lot to take in. Oh boy. I am going to need to get my bearings for this one. https://tenor.com/view/d-phil-oh-my-facepalm-gif-12957789 What would the acronym "NFT" stand for it existed in Hyrule?  Asking for a friend.  Nice. 😋  That happens to me a lot when I play games.  I play them for a bit, get bored, and then come back and love it. I want that put on the box art for the game. Why is this quote so amazing. 😂 Wow! That's not a lot of stuff. Maybe the video is the problem. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Memory Erasing Sonic Screw Drivers Me: Slowly walks out of chat and erases memory. I'm looking it up now.  I didn't even know about a BotW nuzlocke 😮 I didn't buy many games for the Wii U. Usually I play Wii games one. I don't have a favorite Zelda game (it's too hard to choose!) but Twilight Princess is the game I have played the most. I still play on a Wii U (and on PC)  I do! Almost as good as Navi. Fi is great. Seems like a big upgrade so I like it! The gameplay is a little slow, but if you love dungeons then it's perfect for you.  It's Coincidence! I had planned to make the episode for weeks now.  Now we're cooking! That's a nice loaf. Have fun! Yah, the giant ones. The Ganon Horses are found to the south near Lake Hylia. That is hilarious! I didn't know that could happen.  Oh dang! That's weird.  The first episode is a trailer, but the rest of it is a playlist. Is it not working? But I literally just sent a playlist link a few messages ago. I sent a link. Way ahead of you! I did a Twilight Princess lets play back in 2019. It isn't my best work, but if you want to see it then go here... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLxElKbx2iU&list=PLmWFiszEHip67fLJk2SrQM8QNYNvRdE_V  Not planning on it. I don't have anything new to tell people about it.  I'm doing well. Thanks for asking. I spent the last few hours watching my old videos, looking for inspiration.  Shut yer yap, cheese head! 😂  On the contrary I appreciate pings since it helps me find messages. Of course! The reason "thicc" can be seen as inappropriate is because it can be seen in a "sexual or humorous way".  On this server it is alright to use the term thicc in a humorous way, but in regards to people's body parts it's best we avoid it. I can goof with that! So we made a 2nd general chat to replace it for a day. If I remember correctly, I accidentally made it so that people could only post once every 12 hours in general chat. 😅 It was supposed to be a short joke, but it turns out once you have the setting enabled members need to wait out the full 12 hours until they can post again (even if the setting is disabled). That was from a fiasco back in February. Although we do have a  which got privated. Yah, it didn't go anywhere. Me too. It's a nice animation. I read that too. Ayy, that's a fun one! It's confusing and inconsistent, but that's what the lore says. Something like that, yah! Yah, as Pixel said.  It seems like the Triforce has no cap to it's power. But if you die then your wishes are reverted. (However, the damage you do with your wishes stays.) ^ This Explosives, a blow torch, and a jar of peanut butter. I only know this stuff because I check on Zelda news daily. Nah, you probably were told bad info. That's not your fault. He might be right, but he's far from a credible source. Anouma did not say BotW was coming out in 2022. A random gaming industry analyst said that. He's exercising. That was nice.  Smooth as salsa! Oh yah, Twilight Princess had Pumpkins, Cheese, and Fish. Fly 😄 We all have to pick and choose. Nobody blames yah Game! He probably means this video... But on that note...  What theories do you think have holes? He also makes good ranking videos and easter egg hunts. Then say "I don't like his theories." You shouldn't dislike a person based on their theories for a fictional game series. Poor Link Ay! Thanks Cheese. 😄 That is WAY to generous, but I accept. E! Thanks for the round of applause. Amen No idea! It's from the beta game sadly, so this area doesn't exist in the base game. The Fishing Rod should return in the sequel to BotW. (Jumps out window) No he's not. I stalk the bread pirate. I know his every movement. And sleep is better than compromises. E! Compromises are better than nothing. Yes he is. I just us an Xbox controller. Even for BotW. I don't know how this works, but I love it. 😍 I like the tan one.  Way to use some pro-strats. 😄 All of them are awesome. It's hard to choose. Revali is cool.  Maybe it's tilted so that it looks cooler. 🤔 No Me neither! Nice Landing! No idea! But probably not the 500 hours Nintendo claimed. Very creative. Oh dang! It looks nice. I never in a million years expected to love the way the Xenoblade chestpiece looks. But I have been proven wrong. That's really cool! I can't play, but I want to keep my eye on it. Random dungeons seems more do-able. That would be awesome, albeit, difficult to implement. BotW your first time. Haha, alright. That was a good pun.  I have heard other people who say the same thing about AoC. If I play it I'll do it on normal or easy difficulty so that it's less spongy. Oh? Zeltik has inspired me for YEARS. Even his earliest videos were super professional.  Plus it's Zelda! So who doesn't love that. Obviously! But I had to convert it into a Gif. This is a favorite of mine. ^ I made the gif myself. 😄 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/722086066596741147/738086509013630986/Samus_is_Serious.gif I'd love to see Donkey Kong join the pirate side of the force! Hehehe, me neither. Thanks Goose! Nope! But I'll still do it soon. Oh, yah. That happened a week or two ago. I'll be doing a run for the Bread % soon enough. Whoa, hold on... that's a totally different issue.  😅 But that's not THE tutorial, if you know what I mean. That's a later one.  I couldn't fix the tutorial in BotW if I wanted to. It's already designed in a way that's fun. The game tells you only what is necessary for the quest, and then lets you figure out the rest. The beginning doesn't tell you how to Shield Surf either, but that is because you don't **need** it. Are you referring to the Croton video? No, I said the word "without" before it. I think that the tutorials in BotW were brilliant.  The entire Great Plateau is a tutorial in a way, and it teaches you everything you need to know without telling you directly. I think Nintendo deserves props for that. No, Kilometers. You're Super Man! I knew you knew it! I was just reminding people who didn't remember. 😄 My finals are this December. I'm a college student. 😄  Of course I'm doing the Bread%! What do you take me for? Raw cod?! I won't be doing it any time soon due to college, but as soon as finals are over you can count me in. Oh no! Not the conspiracy theories! Yah, I'm not so sure about that. To say that Ganondorf was waiting outside of the Temple of Time for Navi requires a lot of logical leaps. Than again, I'm not a theorist. I'm an analysist. I guarantee, within a week someone will be getting a lot of views on Youtube because of this mod. 🤔 It's so easy to meme. This would make such a fun video, but I'm too busy to do it right now. https://gamebanana.com/maps/212889 These modders are getting more and more crazy by the week. What the heck. Why is Minecraft a BotW mod now! I have a flintlock! The video is hypothetical, so you don't need to worry about that. :D It goes over three ideas for guns that would fit into the Zelda formula. I am so diabolical. https://tenor.com/view/the-simpsons-mr-burns-muahahaha-evil-laugh-gif-4482837 I am adding a vignette effect to the thumbnail and no one can stop me. It's a trademark at this point. It's also the color on Zeltik's thumbnails. A lot of Zeltubers have riffed off the green titles he does. Crap. My thumbnail is gonna melt. Um... envy? Sounds like a plan then! What about adding a green gradient to it? Up it is then!  It's a shorter episode, but I think it is going to turn out alright.  I'll need your input for this thumbnail above. You get a shoutout in the intro too! You inspired the episode after all. Need some help with a thumbnail. Should I have the title be up or down? Darn Cemu That looks like a complicated and sophisticated plan! Good luck. Of course I would! Oh, in that case feel free to feel sorry for me. Why are you sorry? I think it looks cool too. But that doesn't mean it's a good change. Nintendo literally added Si-Fi robots into BotW with helicopter blades and lasers. Don't underestimate them. 😄 I'm cool with no guns. Zelda is a Medieval fantasy game. When I want a game with guns I play a different franchise. I'd be fine with tossing durability and not bothering with blacksmiths. But I think that's unlikely at this point. Oh, I didn't know we were just looking for a vocab word. 😋 Oh! Well I'd say the Gorons if I had a choice. But all the races show an ability to craft/repair weapons. Wait, I'm missing something. What is this about breaking weapons? 🤔 Wow! That's nuts! Sidon! 😖 Young Purah/Robbie? I'm excited to watch it! Nah, I'm worried about plot. If you want to chare gameplay then please do. Thanks for sharing Wii! I haven't been watching any Age of Calamity stuff myself. I'm trying not to spoil it before it comes out. Deal lord, at least the spin off got something right. 😄  Having lower level areas scale isn't a bad idea! So long as it's a toggleable setting I'm fine with it. I still like the feeling of being more powerful as I progress though the game and it's fun to occasionally relax and beat up lower level enemies. That is true!  But in the sequel I hope they do a little bit more to make exploration difficult. That way you have more of an incentive to find items which make new areas accessible. No, you're right. There are too many to keep track of. 😁  It's not even a new idea. Zelda games since the original have included Area Difficulty. It just means that you have to prepare more before entering certain areas. (Think about the mountains in Zelda 1 which had Lynels everywhere) It was Croton. I haven't watched the video yet however. It's so weird that BotW hides a leveling system within the game.  I think it makes more sense for enemy difficulty to be area specific. (Or at least the option for leveling should be togglable) Yah, I like Zelda 2 for expanding combat and for it's art style, but I relent that it isn't a good Zelda game. That's such a great way to be introduced to the series. Because it was the only 2d Zelda where I liked the exploration. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ For a long time, Zelda 1 was the only 2d Zelda game I cared about. I specialize in 3d games, but even I have to admit that the 2d games need more love. I saw that thread too! Its A Link to the Past. It inspired so many of the songs, lore, characters, items, and exploration mechanics we know. OOT was inspirational for being the first 3d game. Not as much to say though. Thanks Arch. 😁 https://media.tenor.com/images/a2e8f736d5807db593339faddacb39bf/tenor.gif Kind of a dark joke though. Look up Donner Party if you're curious. It was intentional. :D I can wait to have ~~Donner~~ dinner parties. Hunger system? A very slow secondary effect! 🤔 Rusty Weapons look cool. Change my mind. 😋 You can change that in the settings. https://tenor.com/view/objection-gif-8497967 See yah there boss! I've tried Twitch in the past to experiment with how it works. My conclusion is that it's just Youtube Livestreaming for people that want more funding. That might be a gross simplification, but if I'm going to be a **Youtuber** then I might as well stick to Youtube Streaming. 😋  Of course! Discord is way simpler than Youtube or Twitch, so that's what I'm going to stick with in the foreseeable future. Indeed. :D We can move to general in a minute. He's such a great guy. He also said I need to make another video soon or my channel will implode. o_o Alright he said we don't have the budget for Twitch. https://tenor.com/view/pusheen-phone-telephone-happy-talking-gif-4858844 Seems like a weird business decision. 🤔 Let me consult my attorney. Should I? Nope.  That's a good idea! I'll try that.  We have one today if you're interested. A Link to the Past style. 😄 I want to do random streams throughout the week as well, but I worry what people will think if I don't announce the stream before hand. 🤔 But I need to if I want to watch your streams. 😄 In the future I think I'll be switching my stream time to a Sunday so that we can both stream on the same weekend. That makes sense. Good luck rethinking things.  It's dangerous to go alone. Take this!🥚 Sorry. 😅 I mean that they all pop out of the ground, not that they get "activated" for teleportation. > Nope.  Taking a break this week Shucks. > How does that work? Link gets ahold of the Shiekah Slate and it activates all the towers. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Not sure how that works, but as soon as he touches it, they activate. Planning on streaming today? Might have not been in the trailer, but it IS in the gameplay showcase. I was a little shocked that they brought back Shiekah Towers though. o_o Me too! It was a run of the mill Mini Direct. Not bad, not nuts. Twilight Princess had the hardest puzzles. Gosh they were tough. I didn't hear it earlier, sorry. Oh! That's not a bad idea. Why? Are you censoring the Master sword? Ooo! That would be cool. But there are 100+ weapons in the game. Could Nintendo pull that off? Ooo! I like cool ideas. The clothing system for upgrades is admittedly a bit jank. It doesn't include all DLC clothing and it's repetative. I'm not sure how it would be fixed yet though. So you won't improve it at all? (Or at least most of them, cause as much as I'd love to ramble for 20+ minutes, I don't think that makes for entertaining content.) You make some really good points! I'll make sure to add them into the episode. 😄  If you had the ability to repair your swords at towns, then wouldn't that encourage the player to stop exploring whenever a sword was about to break?  How would you fix durability for BotW2 if you were in charge? Ayy, what's yall's opinions on weapon durability in Breath of the Wild? There are three /rank roles which you can find in the Rules channel. Yah, you can get a custom rank doing that. But you should do the command in spam. It makes sense financially. Oh darn. At least there are emulators. I don't even have my Wii U right now. I left it at home while I went to college. Scary stuff.  That sounds like a great idea for a video! Make sure to talk about Twilight Princess's Sacared Grove. That's the hardest puzzle in the series. Furthermore, how deep is the elevator you go down to get there? *Pulls out a gun* Aw crap! I forgot this is a family friendly server and we don't have any bullets for these things. Hey! Stop right there!  Wait a minute, there aren't any donkeys in that picture! Hylians Cow Oh, then that should be normal. Your game is cursed! <:Nut:723608947830816778> I don't think so. It's harder than most Zelda games, but it's not crazy hard. Fixed It's strange that people think the dungeons were too short in this game! I've been in here for 3 years. It is dark and boring. I still haven't made it out of the starting dungeon. Help me please... I almost never visited his place. I still don't which is ironic since it's in one of my favorite regions. Ayy that's cool. More than one of you just finished it. I set it to 6 hour slow chat for a minute. Hopefully we can see that in the sequel! That would be awesome. Congratulations! How did you like the ending? Holy! Good luck then. 😉 That is only true at the end of the game for me. I don't use the Master Sword most of the time. Oh snap!  First
